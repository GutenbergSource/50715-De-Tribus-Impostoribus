<HTML><BODY>The <i>De Tribus Impostoribus</i>, or "Treatise on the three impostors", is a unique book. Unique in that it was heard about, heavily criticized, and banned, but never read, half a millennium before it was even written. It's title alone was enough to arouse rage and anger with religious institutions, as the three impostors of the title refer to Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, for calling the founding figure of their religion an impostor, and maybe even worse, for equating him with the founding figures of their competing creeds; and its mythical nature meant it couldn't be attacked on its content. It was only in the early 18th century -- the time of the enlightenment --  that some freethinkers took up the challenge and actually produced a book under this title. The book is a kind of a mystification, pretending to be the medieval book so many religious leaders have fulminated against. Who's done it, and its history is still something of a mystery. The original book was in Latin, but translations in French, and German also appeared. Two English translations where made, one in 1846 and one in 1904. I will run both through PG; this is the 1904 edition, with quite a long introduction. A further, fascinating account of this book is available in the 2012 book <i>The Atheist's Bible: The Most Dangerous Book That Never Existed</i>, by Georges Minois.

<p>Several citations in Latin and French, but no particular difficulties expected.
