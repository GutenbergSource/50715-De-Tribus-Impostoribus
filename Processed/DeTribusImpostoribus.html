<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This pamphlet in its present form is the result of an
inquiry into the characters represented in a historical grade of the
Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite, and the probability of their having
existed at the date mentioned in the said grade. Few appeared to have
any very clear notion of the relation of the characters to the
period&mdash;Frederick II. being confounded with his grand-father,
Frederick Barbarossa&mdash;and the date of the supposed foundation of
the Order of Teutonic Knights, 1190, being placed as the date of the
papacy of Oronata, otherwise Honorius III. Inquiry being made of one in
authority as to the facts in the case&mdash;he being supposed to
know&mdash;elicited the reply that the matter had been called to his
attention some months previous by an investigator&mdash;now
deceased&mdash;but the matter had been dropped. It was also surmised by
the same authority that an error might have been made by one of the
committee having ritualistic matter in charge&mdash;but he, having also
been gathered to his fathers, was not available for evidence.</p>
<p>It is stated that the action took place when Frederick II. was
Emperor of Germany, and Honorius III. presided over spiritual
conditions; but this Pope, according to <i>Haydn&rsquo;s Dictionary of
Dates</i>, reigned 1216&ndash;1227, and the dissertation on the
pamphlet names Gregory IX., successor to Honorius, (1227&ndash;1241) as
the Pope against whom the treatise was written. The infamous book
mentioned in the representation no one <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>seemed to have any knowledge
of. Inquiry made concerning the treatise at various libraries supposed
to possess it, and of various individuals who might know something of
it, elicited but the information that it was purely
&ldquo;legendary,&rdquo; that, &ldquo;it had no existence except by
title,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;it was an item of literature entirely
lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having been a book collector and a close reader of book catalogs for
over twenty-five years, I had never noted any copy offered for sale,
but a friend with the same mania for books, had seen a copy mentioned
in a German catalog, and being interested in &ldquo;<i lang="la">de
tribus Impostoribus</i>&rdquo; for reasons herein mentioned, had sent
for and procured the same&mdash;an edition of a Latin version compiled
from a Ms. 1598, with a foreword in German. The German was familiar to
him, but the Latin was not available.</p>
<p>About the same time I found in a catalog of a correspondent of mine
at London, a book entitled &ldquo;<span class="sc" lang="fr">Les Trois
Imposteurs</span>. <i lang="la">De Tribus Impostoribus et dissertation
sur le livre des Trois Imposteurs, sm. 4to. Saec. XVIII.</i>,&rdquo;
and succeeded in purchasing it.</p>
<p>The manuscript is well written, and apparently by two different
hands, which would be probable from the facts set forth in the
&ldquo;Dissertation.&rdquo; A copy of the translation from the Latin is
probably deposited in the library of Duke Eugene de Subaudio as set
forth in the colophon at end of the manuscript.</p>
<p>The manuscript is written in the French of the period, and is dated
in the colophon as 1716. The discovery of the original Latin document
is mentioned in the &ldquo;Dissertation&rdquo; as about 1706. It has
been annotated by another hand, as shown by foot notes, and several
inserted sheets containing notes in still another <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>hand, were
written evidently about 1746, as one of the sheets is a portion of a
letter postmarked <i lang="fr">4e Aout</i> in latter year.</p>
<p>I append a bibliography from <span class="corr" id="xd26e259" title=
"Source: Werner&rsquo;s">Weller&rsquo;s</span> Latin reprint of 1598
which will show that the pamphlet has &ldquo;been done before&rdquo;;
but it will be noted that English versions are not so plenty as those
in other tongues, and but one is known to have been printed in the
United States.</p>
<p>I must acknowledge my indebtedness to <span lang="la">Doctissimus
vir Harpocrates</span>, Col. F. Montrose, and Maj. Otto Kay for valued
assistance in languages with which I am not thoroughly familiar, and
also to Mr. David Hutcheson, of the Library of Congress, for favors
granted.</p>
<p>Ample apologies will be found for the treatise in the several
introductions quoted from various editions, and those fond of literary
curiosities will certainly be gratified by its appearance in the
twentieth century.</p>

<h2 class="main">BIBLIOGRAPHY.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In 1846, Emil Weller published &ldquo;<i lang="la">De
Tribus Impostoribus</i>,&rdquo; and also a later edition in 1876, at
Heilbronn, from a Latin copy of one of the only four known to be in
existence and printed in 1598. The copy from which it was taken,
consisting of title and forty-six leaves, quarto, is at the Royal
Library at Dresden, and was purchased for one hundred gulden.</p>
<p>The other three, according to Ebert in his &ldquo;Bibliographical
Lexicon,&rdquo; are as follows: one in the Royal Library at Paris, one
in the Crevanna Library and the other in the library of Renouard.</p>
<p>An edition was published at Rackau, in Germany, in 1598, and Thomas
Campanella (1636), in his &ldquo;<i lang="la">Atheismus
Triumphatus</i>,&rdquo; gives the year of its first publication as
1538.</p>
<p>Florimond Raimond (otherwise Louis Richeome,) claims to have seen a
copy owned by his teacher, Peter Ramus, who died in 1572.</p>
<p>All the talk of theological critics that the booklet was first
printed in the seventeenth century, is made out of whole cloth.</p>
<p>There is nothing modern about the edition of 1598. It may be
compared, for example, with Martin Wittel&rsquo;s print of the last
decade of the sixteenth century, by which it is claimed that it could
not have been printed then, as the paper and printing of that period
closely resembles that of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>With the exception of the religious myths, few <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>writings of
the dark ages have had as many hypotheses advanced in regard to origin
as there have been regarding this one.</p>
<p>According to John Brand it had been printed at Krakau, according to
others, in Italy or Hungary as a translation of an Arabic original
existing somewhere in France.</p>
<p>William Postel mentions a tract &ldquo;<i lang="la">de Tribus
Prophetis</i>,&rdquo; and gives Michael Servetus, a Spanish doctor, as
the author.</p>
<p>The Capuchin Monk Joly, in Vol. III of his &ldquo;Conference of
Mysteries,&rdquo; assures us that the Huguenot, Nic. Barnaud, in 1612,
on account of an issue of &ldquo;<i lang="la">de Tribus
Impostoribus</i>,&rdquo; was excommunicated as its author.</p>
<p>Johann Mueller, in his &ldquo;<span lang="de">Besiegten
Atheismus</span>,&rdquo; (Conquered <span class="corr" id="xd26e316"
title="Source: Atheist">Atheism</span>), mentions a certain Nachtigal
who published at Hague, in 1614, &ldquo;<i lang="la">De Trib.
Imp.</i>,&rdquo; and was therefore exiled.</p>
<p>Mosheim and Rousset accuse Frederick II as the author with the
assistance of his Chancellor, Petrus de Vineis. Vineis, however,
declares himself opposed even to the fundamental principles of the
book, and in his &ldquo;<i lang="la">Epist. Lib. 1, ch. 31, p.
211</i>,&rdquo; says he never had any idea of it.</p>
<p>Others place the authorship with Averroes, Peter Arretin and Petrus
Pomponatius. Heinrich Ernst accuses the above mentioned Postel. Postel
attributes it to Servetus, who, in turn, places it at the door of the
Huguenot Barnaud.</p>
<p>The instigator of the treatise, it is claimed, should have been
Julius Cesar Vanini, who was burned at Toulouse in 1619, or Ryswick,
who suffered at the stake in Rome in 1612. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span></p>
<p>Other persons accused of the authorship are Macchiavelli, Rabelais,
Erasmus, Milton (John, born 1608,) a Mahometan named Merula, Dolet, and
Giordano Bruno.</p>
<p>According to Campanella, to whom the authorship was attributed
occasionally, Muret, or Joh. Franz. Poggio, were responsible. Browne
says it was Bernhard Ochini, and Maresius lays it to Johann
Boccaccio.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;three cheats&rdquo; are Moses, Jesus and Mahomet, but the
tracts of each of the latter alleged authors treat only of Moses, of
whom they say that his assertions in Genesis will not hold water, and
cannot be proved.</p>
<p>Weller, in his edition of 1876, speaking of the copy of 1598, says
that this issue should never be compared with any of the foregoing.</p>
<p>Many authors have written &ldquo;<i lang="la">de Tribus
Impostoribus</i>&rdquo; because they had some special object in view;
for instance, John Bapt. Morinus, when he edited, under the name of
Vincentius Panurgius, in Paris, 1654, an argument against
Gassendi<span class="corr" id="xd26e345" title="Source: .">,</span>
Neure, and Bernier.</p>
<p>Joh. Evelyn with a &ldquo;<i lang="la">Historia de tribus hujus
<span class="corr" id="xd26e352" title="Source: se culi">seculi</span>
famosis Impostoribus</i>,&rdquo; Padre Ottomano, Mahomed Bei, otherwise
Joh. Mich. Cigala, and Sabbatai Sevi (English 1680, German
1669,)<a class="noteref" id="xd26e356src" href="#xd26e356" name=
"xd26e356src">1</a> Christian <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href=
"#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>Kortholt &ldquo;<i lang="la">de
Tribus Impostoribus Magnus</i>,&rdquo; (Kiel 1680 and Hamburg 1701,)
against Herbert, Hobbes and Spinosa, Hadrian Beverland, Perini del
Vago, Equitis de Malta, &ldquo;<i lang="la">Epistolium ad Batavum in
Brittania hospitem de tribus Impostoribus</i>,<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e391" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> (Latin and English
1709.)</p>
<p>Finally, Michael Alberti, under the name of Andronicus, published a
&ldquo;<i lang="la">Tractatus Medico-historicus de tribus
Impostoribus</i>,&rdquo; which he named the three great Tempters of
Humanity: 1. Tea and Coffee. 2. Laziness. 3. Home apothecaries.</p>
<p>Cosmopoli Bey (Peter Martin Roman), issued at Russworn in Rostock in
1731, and a new edition of same treatise&mdash;<i lang="la">De Trib.
Imp.</i>&mdash;1738 and 1756.</p>
<p>For a long time scholars confused the genuine Latin treatise with a
later one. De la Monnoye fabricated a long dissertation in which he
denied the existence of the original Latin edition, but received a well
merited refutation at the hands of P. F. Arpe.</p>
<p>The false book is French&mdash;&ldquo;<i lang="fr">La vie et
l&rsquo;esprit de Mr. Benoit Spinoza</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e412src" href="#xd26e412" name="xd26e412src">2</a> The author of
the first part <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>was Hofrath Vroes, in Hague, and the second was
written by Dr. Lucas. It made its first appearance at Hague 1719, and
later in 1721, under the title &ldquo;<i lang="la">de Tribus
Impostoribus</i>,&rdquo; <i lang="fr">des Trois Imposteurs</i>.
Frankfort-on-the-Main at the expense of the Translator (<i>i. e.</i>
Rotterdam.)</p>
<p>Richard la Selve prepared a third edition under the original title
of &ldquo;The Life of Spinoza,&rdquo; by one of his Disciples. Hamburgh
(really in Holland,) 1735.</p>
<p>In 1768 there was printed by M. M. Rey, at Amsterdam, a new edition
called a &ldquo;Treatise of the Three Impostors;&rdquo; immediately
after another edition appeared at Yverdoner 1768, another in Holland
1775, and a later one in Germany 1777.</p>
<p>The contents of &ldquo;<span lang="fr">L&rsquo;esprit de
Spinoza</span>&rdquo; (German) by Spinoza II, or Subiroth
Sopim&mdash;Rome, by Widow Bona Spes 5770&mdash;(Vieweg in Berlin
1787,) are briefly Chap. I, Concerning God. Chap. II, Reasons why men
have created an invisible Being which is commonly called God. Chap.
III, What the word Religion signifies, and how and why so many of these
Religions have crept into the world. Chap. IV, Evident truths. Chap. V,
Of the Soul. Chap. VI, Of Ghosts, Demons, etc. Then follows fifteen
chapters which are not in the treatise (? Edition 1598.) <span class=

<p>The following became known by reason of peculiarities of their

<p class="first">The Translator of the following little treatise deems
it necessary to say a few words as to the object of its publication. It
is given to the world, neither with a view to advocate Scepticism, nor
to spread Infidelity, but simply to vindicate the right of private
judgment. No human being is in a position to look into the heart, or to
decide correctly as to the creed or conduct of his fellow mortals; and
the attributes of the Deity are so far beyond the grasp of limited
reason, that man must become a God himself before he can comprehend
them. Such being the case, surely all harsh censure of each
other&rsquo;s opinions and actions ought to be abandoned; and every one
should so train himself as to be enabled to declare with the humane and
manly philosopher</p>

l&rsquo;imprimerie philosophique</i>,&rdquo; 1793.</p>
<p>In a response to M. de la Monnoye, who laboriously endeavored to
refute the existence of the treatise entitled &ldquo;The Three
Impostors,&rdquo; and which reply in addition to M. de la
Monnoye&rsquo;s arguments appear in connection with some of the
translations of the treatise, occurs the following introduction to the
account of the discovery of the original manuscript: &ldquo;I have by
me a more certain means of overturning this dissertation of M. de la
Monnoye, when I inform him that I have read this celebrated little work
and that I have it in my library. I will give you and the public an
account of the manner in which I discovered it, and as it is in my
possession I will subjoin a short but faithful description of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here follows a summary of the contents and the Dissertation, in
substance the same as our manuscript; the response concluding as
follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such is the anatomy of this celebrated work. I might have
given it in a manner more extended and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>more minute; but besides
that this letter is already too long, I think that enough has been said
to give insight into the nature of its contents. A thousand other
reasons which you will well enough understand, have prevented me from
entering upon it to so great length as I could have done;

"xd26e1213src">12</a> with the preface in which I have given its
history, and its discovery, with some conjectures as to its origin, and
a few remarks which may be placed at its conclusion, yet I do not
believe that it will live to see the day when men will be compelled all
at once to quit their opinions and their imaginations, as they have
quitted their syllogisms, their canons, and their other antiquated
modes. As for me I will not expose myself to the <i>Theological
stylus</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e1224src" href="#xd26e1224" name=
"xd26e1224src">13</a>&mdash;which I fear as much as Fra-Poula feared
the Roman stylus&mdash;to afford to a few learned men the pleasure of
reading this little treatise; but neither will I be so superstitious,
on my death bed, as to cause it to be thrown into the flames, which we
are informed was done by Salvius, the Swedish ambassador, <span class=

<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;The Duc de la Valliere and the Abbe de
St. Leger, once concerted together to supply the eager purchaser of
literary rarities with a copy of &ldquo;De Tribus Impostoribus,&rdquo;
a book, by the date, pretended to have been printed in 1598, though
probably a modern forgery of 1698. The title of such a book had long
existed by rumor, but never was a copy seen by man. Works printed with
this title have all been proved to be modern fabrications&mdash;a copy
however of the &lsquo;<span lang="fr">introuvable</span>&rsquo;
original was sold at the Duc de la Valliere&rsquo;s sale. The history
of this volume is curious. The Duc and the Abbe having manufactured a
text had it printed in the old Gothic character, under the title
&lsquo;<span lang="la">De Tribus Impostoribus</span>.&rsquo; They
proposed to put the great bibliopobet, De Bure, in good humor, whose
agency would sanction the imposition. They were afterwards to dole out
copies at 25 louis each, which would have been a reasonable price for a
book which no one ever saw! They invited De Bure to dinner, flattered
and cajoled him, and, as they imagined at the moment they had wound him
up to their pitch, they exhibited their manufacture&mdash;the keen-eyed
glance of the renowned cataloguer of the &lsquo;<span lang=
"fr">Bibliographie Instructive</span>&rsquo; instantly shot like
lightning over it, and like lightning, destroyed the whole edition. He
not only discovered the forgery but reprobated it! He refused his
sanction; and the forging Duc and Abbe, in confusion suppressed the
&lsquo;<span lang="fr">livre introuvable</span>&rsquo;; but they owed a
grudge to the honest bibliographer and attempted to write down the work

the <i>printing</i> of the book they can bring forward no <i>proof</i>
whatever of its having being done prior to this date (1716) and it is
impossible to conceive that Frederick, surrounded as he was by enemies,
would have circulated a work which gave a fair opportunity of
proclaiming his infidelity. It is probable therefore that there were
only two copies, the original one and that sent to Otho of Bavaria. J.

attacked one evening by an assassin. Fortunately the blow did not prove
fatal; but the weapon (a stylus, or dagger, which is also the Latin
name for a pen) having been left in the wound, on his recovery he wore
it in his girdle labelled, &ldquo;The Theological Stylus,&rdquo; or Pen
of the Church. The trenchant powers of this instrument have more

<h2 class="main">DISSERTATION ON THE BOOK OF THE THREE IMPOSTORS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">More than four hundred years have elapsed since this
little treatise was first mentioned, the title of which has always
caused it to be qualified as impious, profane and worthy of the fire. I
am convinced that none of those who have mentioned it have read it, and
after having examined it carefully, it can only be said that it is
written with as much discretion as the matter would allow to a man
persuaded of the falsehood of the things which he attacked, and
protected by a powerful prince, under whose direction he wrote.</p>
<p>There have been but few scholars whose religious beliefs were
dubious, who have not been credited with the authorship of this
treatise.</p>
<p><i><span class="corr" id="xd26e1251" title=
"Source: Avervoes">Averroes</span></i>, a famous Arabian commentator on
Aristotle&rsquo;s works, and celebrated for his learning, was the first
to whom this production was attributed. He lived about the middle of
the twelfth century when the &ldquo;three impostors&rdquo; were first
spoken of. He was not a Christian, as he treated their religion as
&ldquo;the Impossible,&rdquo; nor a Jew, whose law he called &ldquo;a
Religion for Children,&rdquo; nor a Mahometan, for he denominated their
belief &ldquo;a Religion for Hogs.&rdquo; He finally died a
Philosopher, that is to say, without having subscribed to the opinions
of the vulgar, and that was sufficient to publish him as the enemy of
the law makers of the three Religions that he had scorned.</p>
<p><i>Jean Bocala</i>, an Italian scholar of a happy disposition, and
consequently not much imbued with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27"
href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>bigotry, flourished in the
middle of the fourteenth century. A fable that he ventured in one of
his works, concerning &ldquo;Three Rings,&rdquo; has been regarded as
evidence of this execrable book whose author was looked for, and this
was considered sufficient to attribute the authorship to him long after
his death.</p>
<p><i>Michael Servetus</i>, burned at Geneva (1553) by the pitiless
persecution of <i>Mr. John Calvin</i>, he not having subscribed
<span class="corr" id="xd26e1267" title="Not in source">to</span>
either the Trinity or the Redeemer, it became proper to attribute to
him the production of this impious volume.</p>
<p><i>Etienne Dolit</i>, a printer at Paris, and who ranked among the
learned, was led to the stake&mdash;to which he had been condemned as a
Calvinist in 1543&mdash;with a courage comparable to that of the first
martyrs. He therefore merited to be treated as an atheist, and was
honored as the author of the pamphlet against the &ldquo;Three
Impostors.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lucilio Vanini</i>, a Neapolitan, and the most noted atheist of
his time, if his enemies may be believed, fairly proved before his
judges&mdash;however he may have been convinced&mdash;the truth of a
Providence, and consequently a God. It sufficed however for the
persecution of his enemies, the Parliament of Toulouse, who condemned
him to be burned as an atheist, and also to merit the distinction of
having composed, or at least having revived, the book in question.</p>
<p>I am not sure but what <i>Ochini</i> and <i>Postel</i>,
<i>Pomponiac</i> and <i>Poggio</i> the Florentine, and
<i>Campanella</i>, all celebrated for some particular opinion condemned
by the Church of their time, were for that reason accused as atheists,
and also adjudged without trouble, the authors of the little truth for
whom a parent was sought. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href=
"#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span></p>
<p>All that famous critics have published from time to time of this
book has excited the curiosity of the great and wise to determine the
author, but without avail.</p>
<p>I believe that several treatises printed with the title
&ldquo;<i lang="la">de Tribus Impostoribus</i>,&rdquo; such as that of
<i>Kortholt</i> against <i>Spinosa</i>, <i>Hobbes</i> and the <i>Baron
Cherbourg</i>; that of the false <i>Panurge</i> against <i lang=
"fr">Messieurs Gastardi</i>, <i>de Neure</i> and <i>Bernier</i> have
furnished many opportunities for an infinity of half-scholars who only
speak from hearsay, and who often judge a book by the first line of the
title. I have, like many others who have examined this work, done so in
a superficial manner. Though I am a delver in antiquities, and a
decipherer of manuscript, chance having caused the pamphlet to fall
into my hands at one time, I avow that I gave neither thought to the
production nor to its author.</p>
<p>Some business affairs having taken me to
<i>Frankfort-on-the-Main</i> about the month of April, (1706), that is
about fifteen days after the Fair, I called on a friend named
<i>Frecht</i>, a Lutheran theological student, whom I had known in
Paris. One day I went to his house to ask him to take me to a
bookseller where he could serve me as interpreter. We called on the way
on a Jew who furnished me with money and who accompanied us.</p>
<p>Being engaged in looking over a catalog at the book store, a German
officer entered the shop, and said to the bookseller without any form
of compliment, &ldquo;If among all the devils I could find one to agree
with you, I would still go and look for another dealer.&rdquo; The
bookseller replied that &ldquo;500 Rix dollars was an excessive price,
and that he ought to be satisfied with the 450 that he offered.&rdquo;
The officer told him to &ldquo;go <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29"
href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>to the Devil,&rdquo; as he would
do nothing of the sort, and was about to leave. <i>Frecht</i>, who
recognized him as a friend, stopped him and having renewed his
acquaintance, was curious to know what bargain he had concluded with
the bookseller. The officer carelessly drew from his pocket a packet of
parchment tied by a cord of yellow silk. &ldquo;I wanted,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;500 Rix dollars to satisfy me for three manuscripts which
are in this package, but Mr. Bookseller does not wish to give but
450.&rdquo; Frecht asked if he might see the curiosities. The officer
took them from his pocket, and the Jew and myself who had been merely
spectators now became interested, and approached Frecht, who held the
three books.</p>
<p>The first which Frecht opened was an Italian imprint of which the
title was missing, and was supplied by another written by hand which
read</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="it">Specchia della Bestia Triomphante.</i>&rdquo;
The book did not appear of ancient date, and had on the title neither
year nor name of printer.</p>
<p>We passed to the second, which was a manuscript without title, the
first page of which commenced &ldquo;OTHONI <i lang="it">illustrissimo
amico meo charissimo</i>. <i>F. I. s. d.</i>&rdquo; This embraced but
two lines, after which followed a letter of which the commencement was
&ldquo;<i lang="la">Quod de tribus famosissimis Nationum Deceptoribus
in ordinem. Justu. meo digesti Doctissimus ille vir, que cum Sermonem
de illa re in Museo meo habuisti exscribi curavi atque codicem illum
stilo aeque, vero ac puro scriptum ad te ut primum mitto, etenim ipsius
per legendi te accipio cupidissimum.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other manuscript was also Latin, and without title like the
other. It commenced with these words&mdash;from <i>Cicero</i> if I am
not mistaken: &ldquo;<i lang="la">An. I. liber <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>de Nat.
Deor. Qui Deos esse dixerunt tantu sunt in Varietate et dissentione
constituti ut eorum molestum sit dinumerare sententias. Altidum freri
profecto potest ut eorum nulla, alterum certi non potest ut plus unum
vera fit. Summi quos in Republica obtinnerat honores orator ille
Romanus, ea que quam servare famam Studiote curabat, in causa fuere
quod in Concione Deos non ansus sit negare quamquam in contesta
Philosophorum, etc.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>We paid but little attention to the Italian production, which only
interested our Jew, who assured us that it was an invective against
Religion. We examined several phrases of the latter by which we
mutually agreed that it was a system of <i>Demonstrated Atheism</i>.
The second, which we have mentioned, attracted our entire attention,
and Frecht having persuaded his friend, whose name was
<i>Tausendorff</i>, not to take less than 500 Rix dollars, we left the
bookseller&rsquo;s shop, and Frecht, who had his own ideas, took us to
his inn, where he proposed to his friend to empty a bottle of good wine
together. Never did a German decline a like proposition, so Frecht
immediately ordered the wine, and asked Tausendorff to tell us how
these manuscripts fell into his possession.</p>
<p>After enjoying his portion of <i>six</i> bottles of old Moselle, he
told us that after the victory at Hochstadt<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1386src" href="#xd26e1386" name="xd26e1386src">1</a> and the
flight of the Elector of Bavaria, he was one of those who entered
Munich, and in the palace of His Highness, he went from room to room
until he reached the library. Here his eyes fell by chance on the
package of parchments with the silk cord, and believing them to be
important papers or curiosities, he could not resist the temptation of
putting them in his pocket. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href=
"#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>He was not deceived when he opened
the package and convinced himself. This recital was accompanied by many
soldier-like digressions, as the wine had a little disarranged the
judgment of Tausendorff. Frecht, who, during the story, perused the
manuscript, took the chance of a refusal by asking his friend to allow
him to take the book until the next day. Tausendorff, whom the wine had
made generous, consented to the request of Frecht, but he exacted a
terrible oath that he would neither copy it or cause it to be done,
promising to come for it on Sunday and empty some more bottles of wine,
which he found to his taste.</p>
<p>This obliging officer had no sooner left than we commenced to
decipher it. The writing was so small, full of abbreviations, and
without punctuation, that we were nearly two hours in reading the first
page, but as soon as we were accustomed to the method we commenced to
read it more easily. I found it so accurate and written with so much
care, that I proposed to Frecht an equivocal method of making a copy
without violating the oath which he had taken: which method was to make
a <i>translation</i>. The conscience of a <i>theologian</i> did not but
find difficulties in such proposal, but I removed them as I could,
assuming the sin myself, and in the end he consented to work on the
translation which was finished before the time fixed by
Tausendorff.</p>
<p>This is the way in which this book came into our hands. Many would
have desired to possess the original but we were not rich enough to buy
it. The bookseller had a commission from a Prince of the House of
Saxony, who knew that it had been taken from the library at Munich, and
he was to spare no effort to secure it, if he found it, by paying the
500 <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>Rix dollars to Tausendorff who went away several
days after, having regaled us in his turn.</p>
<p>Passing to the origin of the book, and its author, one can hardly
give an account of either only by consulting the book itself in which
but little is found except for the base of conjecture. There is only a
letter at the beginning, and which is written in another character from
the rest of the book, which gives any light. We find it addressed
<i lang="it">OTHONI, Illustrissimo</i>. The place where the manuscript
was found, and the name OTHO put together warrants the belief that it
was addressed to the <i>Illustrious Otho, lord of Bavaria</i>. This
prince was grandson of <i>Otho, the Great; Count of Schiren and
Witelspach</i> from whom the House of Bavaria and the Palatine had
their origin. The Emperor <i>Frederick Barbarossa</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd26e1416src" href="#xd26e1416" name="xd26e1416src">2</a> had given
him Bavaria for his fidelity, after having taken it from <i>Henry the
Lion</i> to punish him for his inconsistency in taking the part of his
enemies. <i>Louis I.</i> succeeded his father, <i>Otho the Great</i>,
and left Bavaria&mdash;in the possession of which he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>had been
disturbed by <i>Henry the Lion</i>&mdash;to his son <i>Otho</i>,
surnamed the <i>Illustrious</i>, who assured his possession by wedding
the daughter of Henry. This happened about the year 1230, when
<i>Frederick II.</i>, Emperor of Germany, returned from Jerusalem,
where, at the solicitation of <i>Pope Gregory IX.</i>, he had pursued
the war against the Saracens, and from whence he returned irritated to
excess against the Holy Father who had incensed his army against him,
as well as the <i>Templars</i> and the <i>Patriarch</i> of
<i>Jerusalem</i>, until the Emperor refused to obey the Pope.</p>
<p><i>Otho the Illustrious</i> recognizing the obligations that his
family were under to the family of the Emperor, took his part and
remained firmly attached to him, notwithstanding all the vicissitudes
of fortune of Frederick.</p>
<p>Why these historical reminiscences? To sustain the conjecture that
it was to this <i>Otho the Illustrious</i> that this copy of the
pamphlet of the <i>Three Impostors</i> was addressed. By whom? This is
why we are led to believe that the F. I. s. d<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e1587" title="Not in source">.</span> which follows <i lang=
"la">L&rsquo;amico meo carissimo</i>, and which we interpret
FREDERICUS. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span><i lang="la">Imperator salutem Domino</i>. Thus
this would be by The <i>Emperor Frederick II.</i>, son of <i>Henry
IV.</i> and grandson of <i>Frederick Barbarossa</i>, who, succeeding to
their Empire, had at the same time inherited the hatred of the Roman
Pontiffs.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1607src" href="#xd26e1607" name=
"xd26e1607src">3</a></p>
<p>Those who have read the history of the Church and that of the
Empire, will recall with what pride and arrogance the indolent
<i>Alexander III.</i> placed his foot on the neck of <i>Frederick
Barbarossa</i>, who came to him to sue for peace. Who does not know the
evil that the Holy See did to his son <i>Henry VI.</i>, against whom
his own wife took up arms at the persuasion of the Pope? At last
<i>Frederick II.</i> uniting in himself all the resolution which was
wanting in his father and grandfather, saw the purpose of <i>Gregory
IX.</i>, who seemed to have marshalled on his side all the hatred of
<i>Alexander</i>, <i>Innocent</i> and <i>Honorius</i> against his
<i>Imperial Majesty</i>. One brought the steel of persecution, and the
other the lightning of excommunication, and furiously they vied with
each other in circulating infamous libels. This, it seems to me, is
warrant sufficient to apply these happenings to the belief that this
book was by order of the Emperor, who was incensed against religion by
the vices of its Chief, and written by the <i lang="la">Doctissimus
vir</i>, who is mentioned in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35"
href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>letter as having composed this
treatise, and which consequently owes its existence not so much to a
search for truth, as to a spirit of hatred and implacable
animosity.</p>
<p>This conjecture may be further confirmed by remarking that this book
was never mentioned only since the <i lang="fr">r&eacute;gime</i> of
that Emperor, and even during his reign it was attributed him, since
<i lang="fr">Pierre des Vignes</i>, his secretary, endeavored to cast
this false impression on the enemies of his master, saying that they
circulated it to render him odious.</p>
<p>Now to determine the <i lang="la">Doctissimus vir</i> who is the
author of the book in question. First, it is certain that the epoch of
the book was that which we have endeavored to prove. Second, that it
was encouraged by those accused of its authorship, possibly excepting
<i><span class="corr" id="xd26e1676" title=
"Source: Avervoes">Averroes</span></i>, who died before the birth of
<i>Frederick II.</i> All the others lived a long time, even entire
centuries after the composition of this work. I admit that it is
difficult to determine the author only by marking the period when the
book first made its appearance, and in whatever direction I turn, I
find no one to whom it could more probably be attributed than <i lang=
"fr">Pierre des Vignes</i> whom I have mentioned.</p>
<p>If we had not his tract &ldquo;<i lang="la">De poteste
Imperiali</i>,&rdquo; his other epistles suffice to show with what zeal
he entered into the resentment of <i>Frederick II.</i> (whose Secretary
he was) against the Holy See. Those who have spoken of him,
<i>Ligonius</i>, <i>Trithemus</i> and <i>Rainaldi</i>, furnish such an
accurate description of him, his condition and his spirit, that after
considering this I cannot remark but that this evidence favors my
conjecture. Again, as I have remarked, he himself spoke of this book in
his epistles, and he endeavored to accuse the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>enemies
of his master to lessen the clamor made to encourage the belief that
this Prince was the author. As he had taken the greater part, he did
not greatly exert himself to lessen the injurious noise, so that if the
accusation was strengthened by passing for a long time from mouth to
mouth it would not fall from the Master on his Secretary, who was
probably more capable of the production than a great Emperor, always
occupied with the clamors of war and always in fear of the thunders of
the Vatican. In one word, the Emperor, however valiant and resolute,
had no time to become a scholar like <i>Pierre des Vignes</i>, who had
given all the necessary attention to his studies, and who owed his
position and the affection of his Master entirely to his learning.</p>
<p>I believe that we can conclude from all this, that this little book
<i lang="la">Tribus famosissimus Nationum Deceptoribus</i>, for that is
its true title, was composed after the year 1230 by command of the
Emperor <i>Frederick II.</i> in hatred of the Court of Rome: and it is
quite apparent that <i>Pierre des Vignes</i>, Secretary to the Emperor,
was the author.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1719src" href="#xd26e1719"
name="xd26e1719src">4</a></p>
<p>This is all that I deem proper for a preface to this little
treatise, and as it contains many naughty allusions, to prevent that in
the future, it may not be again attributed to those who perhaps never
entertained such ideas.</p>

<p>I have taken the trouble to have copied the Treatise which was made
concerning the <i>Three Famous Impostors</i>, by the learned man by
whom you were entertained on this subject, in my study, and though you
have not requested it, I send you the manuscript entire, in which the

could please you more.</p>

<p>I hope that my sword, and the fidelity of the members of the Empire;
your advice and your assistance will contribute not a little. But
nothing would add more if all Germany could be inspired with the

<p class="first">However important it may be for all men to know the
Truth, very few, nevertheless, are acquainted with it, because the
majority are incapable of searching it themselves, or perhaps, do not
wish the trouble. Thus we must not be astonished if the world is filled
with vain and ridiculous opinions, and nothing is more capable of
making them current than ignorance, which is the sole source of the
false ideas that exist regarding the Divinity, the soul, and the
spirit, and all the errors depending thereon.</p>
<p>The custom of being satisfied with born prejudice has prevailed, and
by following this custom, mankind agrees in all things with persons
interested in supporting stubbornly the opinions thus received, and who
would speak otherwise did they not fear to destroy themselves.

having established these silly ideas of God, they teach the people to

absurdities have been plunged, have thrived so well that it is
dangerous to combat them. It is too important for these impostors that
the people remain in this gross and culpable ignorance than to allow

immediately discovering the Truth. It is to prevent the good effects

of inspiring any good sentiment, and however we may censure in general
those who are not reasonable, we must nevertheless be persuaded that
Truth is quite perverted. These enemies of Truth fall also into such
perpetual contradictions that it is difficult to perceive what their

neither is it required to deeply penetrate the secrets of Nature. Only
a little good sense is needed to see that God is neither passionate nor
jealous, that justice and mercy are false titles attributed to him, and
that nothing of what the Prophets and Apostles have said constitutes
his nature nor his essence. In effect, to speak without disguise and to
state the case properly, it is certain that these doctors were neither
more clever or better informed than the rest of mankind, but far from
that, what they say is so gross that it must be the people only who
would believe them.</p>
<p>The matter is self-evident, but to make it more clear, let us see if
they are differently constituted than other men.</p>

<p class="first">As to their birth and the ordinary functions of life,
it is agreed that they possessed nothing above the human; that they
were born of man and woman and lived the same as ourselves. But for
mind, it must be that God favored them more than other men, for they
claimed an understanding more brilliant than others. We must admit that
mankind has a leaning toward blindness, because it is said that God
loved the prophets more than the rest of mankind, that he frequently
communicated with them, and he believed them also of good faith. Now if
this condition was sensible, and without considering that all men
resembled each other, and that they each had a principle <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>equal in
all, it was pretended that these prophets were of extraordinary
attainments and were created expressly to utter the oracles of God. But
further, if they had more wit than common, and more perfect
understanding, what do we find in their writings to oblige us to have
this opinion of them?</p>
<p>The greater part of their writings is so obscure that it is not
understood, and put together in such a poor manner that we can hardly
believe that they comprehended it themselves, and that they must have
been very ignorant impostors. That which causes this belief of them is
that they boasted of receiving directly from God all that they
announced to the people&mdash;an absurd and ridiculous belief&mdash;and
avowing that God only spoke to them in dreams. Dreams are quite
natural, and a person must be quite vain or senseless to boast that God
speaks to him at such a time, and when faith is added, he must be quite
credulous since there is no evidence that dreams are oracles. Suppose
even that God manifested himself by dreams, by visions, or in any other
way, are we obliged to believe a man who may deceive himself, and which
is worse, who is inclined to <i>lie</i>?</p>
<p>Now we see that under the ancient law they had for prophets none
more esteemed than at the present day. Then when the people were tired
of their sophistry, which often tended to turn them from obedience to
their legitimate Ruler, they restrained them by various punishments,
just as Jesus was overwhelmed because he had not, like Moses,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1821src" href="#xd26e1821" name="xd26e1821src">2</a>
an army at his back to sustain his opinions. Added to that, the
Prophets were so in the habit of contradicting each other that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>among four hundred not one reliable one was to be
found.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1826src" href="#xd26e1826" name=
"xd26e1826src">3</a></p>
<p>It is even certain that the aim of their prophecies, as well as the
laws of the celebrated legislators were to perpetuate their memories by
causing mankind to believe that they had private conference with God.
Most political objects have been projected in such manner. However,
such tricks have not always been successful for those, who&mdash;with
the exception of <i>Moses</i>&mdash;had not the means of providing for
their safety.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This being determined, let us examine the ideas which
the Prophets had of God, and we will smile at their grossness and
contradictions. To believe them, God is a purely corporeal being.
<i>Micah</i> sees him seated. <i>Daniel</i> clothed in white and in the
form of an old man, and <i>Ezekiel</i> like a fire. So much for the Old
Testament, now for the New. The disciples of J. C. imagined the Holy
Spirit in the figure of a dove; the apostles, in the form of tongues of
fire, and <i>St. Paul</i>, as a light which dazzled the sight unto
blindness.</p>
<p>To show their contradictory opinions, <i>Samuel</i>, (<a class=
"biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1sam%2015:29&amp;version=NRSV">I.
ch. 15, v. 29</a>), believed that God never repented of his own
resolution. Again, <i>Jeremiah</i>, (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jer%2018:10&amp;version=NRSV">ch.
18, v. 10</a>), says that God repented of a resolve he had taken.
<i>Joel</i>, (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=joel%202:13&amp;version=NRSV">ch.
2, v. 13</a>), says that he only repents of the evil he has done to
mankind. <i>Genesis</i><span class="corr" id="xd26e1877" title=
"Not in source">,</span> (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%204:7&amp;version=NRSV">ch.
4, v. 7</a>), informs us that man is prone to evil, but that He has
nothing for him but blessings. On the contrary, <i>St. Paul</i>,
(<a class="biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%209:10&amp;version=NRSV">Romans,
ch. 9, v. 10</a>), says that men have no <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>command of concupiscence
except by the grace and particular calling of God. These are the noble
sentiments that these good people have of God, and what they would have
us believe. Sentiments, however, entirely sensible, and quite material
as we see, and yet they say that God has nothing in common with matter,
is a sensible and material being, and that he is something
incomprehensible to our understanding. I should like to be informed how
these contradictions may be harmonized, and how, under such visible and
palpable conditions it is proper to believe them. Again, how can we
accept the testimony of a people so clownish that they, notwithstanding
all the artifices of Moses, should imagine a <i>calf</i> to be their
God! But not considering the dreams of a race raised in servitude, and
among the superstitious, we can agree that ignorance has produced
credulity, and credulity falsehood, from whence arises all the errors
which exist today.</p>

invisible Beings, that is to say their own <i>phantoms</i> which they

end they make Gods. And as the visions of men go to extremes, must we
be astonished if there are created an innumerable quantity of
<i>Divinities</i>? It is the same perceptible fear of invisible powers
which has been the origin of Religions, that each forms to his fashion.
Many individuals to whom it was important that mankind should possess
such fancies, have not scrupled to encourage mankind in such beliefs,

<p class="first">It should be agreed that all men are born in profound
ignorance, and that the only thing natural to them is a desire to
discover what may be useful and proper, and evade what may be
inexpedient to them. Thence it follows <i>first</i>, that we believe
that to be free it suffices to feel personally that one can wish and
desire without being annoyed by the causes which dispose us to wish and
desire, because we do not know them. <i>Second</i>, it consequently
occurs that men are contented to do nothing but for one object, that is
to say, for that object which is preferable above all, and that is why
they have a desire only to know the final result of their action,
imagining that after discovering this they have no reason to doubt
anything. Now as they find in and about themselves many means of
procuring what they desire: having, for example, ears to hear, eyes to
see, animals to nourish, a sun to give light, they have formed this
reasoning, <i>that there is nothing in nature which was not made for
them, and of which they may dispose and enjoy</i>. Then reflecting that
they did not make this world, they believe it to be a well-founded
proposition to imagine a Supreme Being who has made it for them such as
it is, for after <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>satisfying themselves that <i>they</i> could not
have made it, they conclude that it was the work of one or several Gods
who intended it for the use and pleasure of man alone. On the other
hand, the nature of the Gods whom man has admitted, being unknown, they
have concluded in their own minds that these Gods susceptible of the
same passions as men, have made the earth only for them, and that man
to them was extremely precious. But as each one has different
inclinations it became proper to adore God according to the humor of
each, to attract his blessings and to cause Him to make all Nature
subject to his desires.</p>

<p class="first">By this method this precedent becomes Superstition,
and it is implanted so that the grossest natures are believed capable
of penetrating the doctrine of final causes as if they had perfect
knowledge. Thus in place of showing that <i>nature has made nothing in
vain</i>, they show that God and Nature dream as well as men, and that
they may not be accused of doubting things, let us see how they have
put forth their false reasoning on this subject.</p>
<p>Experience causing them to see a myriad of inconveniences marring
the pleasure of life, such as storms, earthquakes, sickness, famine and
thirst, they draw the conclusion that nature has not been made for them
alone. They attribute all these evils to the wrath of the Gods, who are
vexed by the offences of man, and they cannot be disabused of these
ideas by the daily instances which should prove to them that blessings
and evils have been always common to the wicked and the good, and they
will not agree to a proposition so plain and perceptible. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span></p>

to abolish a belief established for many centuries and introduce

<p class="first">This precedent has caused another, which is the belief

<p class="first">By this it may be seen that Nature or God does not
propose any end, and that all final causes are but human fictions. A
long lecture is not necessary since this doctrine takes away from God
the perfection ascribed to him, and this is how it may be proved. If
God acted for a result, either for himself or another, he desires what
he has not, and we must allow that there are times when God has not the
wherewith to act; he has merely desired it and that only creates an
impotent God. To omit nothing that may be applied to this reasoning,
let us oppose it with those of a contrary nature. If, for example, a
stone falls on a person and kills him, it is well known they say, that
the stone fell with the design of killing the man, and that could only
happen by the will of God. If you reply that the wind caused the stone
to drop at the moment the man passed, they will ask why the man should
have passed precisely at the time when the wind moved the stone. If you
say that the wind was so severe that the sea was also troubled since
the day before while there appeared to be no agitation in the air, and
the man having been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48"
name="pb48">48</a>]</span>invited to dine with a friend, went to keep
his appointment. Again they ask, for the man never got there, why he
should be the guest of his friend at this time more than another,
adding questions after questions, finally avowing that it was but the
will of God, (which is a true &ldquo;<i>asses bridge</i>&rdquo;) and
the cause of this misfortune.</p>
<p>Again when they note the symmetry of the human body, they stand in
admiration and conclude how ignorant they are of the causes of a thing
which to them appears so marvelous, that it is a supernatural work, in
which the causes known to us could have no part.</p>
<p>Thence it comes that those who desire to know the real cause of
supposed miracles and penetrate like true scholars into their natural
causes without amusing themselves with the prejudice of the ignorant,
it happens that the true scholar passes for impious and heretical by
the malice of those whom the vulgar recognize as the expounders of
<i>Nature</i> and of <i>God</i>. These mercenary individuals do not
question the ignorance which holds the people in astonishment, upon
whom they subsist and who preserve their credit.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Mankind being thus of the ridiculous opinion that all
they see is made for themselves, have made it a religious duty to apply
it to their interest, and of judging the price of things by the profit
they gain. Thence proceed the ideas they have formed of <i>good</i>,
and <i>evil</i>, of <i>order</i> and <i>confusion</i>, of <i>heat</i>
and <i>cold</i>, of <i>beauty</i> and <i>ugliness</i>, which serve to
explain to them the nature of things, which in the end are not what
they imagine. Because they pride themselves in having free will they
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>judge themselves capable of deciding between
<i>praise</i> and <i>blame</i>, <i>sin</i> and <i>merit</i>, calling
everything good which redounds to their profit and which concerns
<i>divine worship</i>, and to the contrary denominate as evil that
which agrees with neither. Because the ignorant are not capable of
judging what may be a little abstruse, and having no idea of things
only by the aid of <i>imagination</i> which they consider
<i>understanding</i>, these folk who know not what represents
<i>Order</i> in the world believe all that they imagine. Man being
inclined in such a manner that they think things well or ill ordered as
they have the facility or trouble to conclude when good sense would
teach differently. Some are more pleased to be weary of the means of
investigation, being satisfied to remain as they are, preferring order
to confusion, as if order was another thing than a pure effect of the
imagination of man, so that when it is said that <i>God has made
everything in order</i>, it is recognizing that he has that faculty of
imagination as well as man. If it was not so, perhaps to favor human
imagination they pretend that God created this world in the easiest
manner imaginable, although there are an hundred things far above the
force of imagination, and an infinity which may be thrown into disorder
by reason of weakness.</p>

<p class="first">For other ideas, they are purely the effect of the
same imagination, which have nothing real, and which are but the
different modes of which this power is capable. For example, if the
movement which objects impress upon the nerves by the means of the eyes
is agreeable to the senses, we say that these objects are beautiful,
that odors are good or bad, that tastes are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>sweet or
bitter, that which we touch hard or soft, sounds, harsh or agreeable.
According as odors, tastes or sounds strike and penetrate the senses,
just so we find a belief that God is capable of taking pleasure in
melody, that the celestial movements are a harmonious concert, proof
evident that each one believes that things are such as they are
imagined, or that the world is purely imaginary. That is why we should
not be surprised if we rarely found two men of the same opinion, and
some who glorify themselves in doubting everything. For while men have
bodies which resemble each other in many particulars, they differ in
some others, and it should not astonish us that what seems good to one
appears bad to another: what pleases this one displeases the other,
from which we may infer that opinions only differ by fancy, that
understanding passes for little, and to conclude, things which happen
every day are purely the effects of imagination. If one should consult
the lights of understanding of philosophers he would have faith that
everybody would agree to the truth, and that judgments would be more
uniform and reasonable than they are.</p>

<p class="first">It is then evident that all the reasons of which men
are accustomed to avail themselves when they endeavor to explain
Nature, are only methods of imagination which prove nothing less than
they pretend, and because they have given to these reasons names so
real that if they existed otherwise than in imagination I would not
call them <i>reasonable beings</i>, but purely chimerical, seeing
nothing more easy than to respond to arguments founded on these vulgar
notions and which we oppose as follows. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span></p>
<p>If it was true that the universe was a chance happening, and a
necessary sequel of divine nature, whence come the imperfections and
faults which we remark? For example, corruption which fills the air
with bad odor, many disagreeable objects, so many disorders, so much
evil, so many crimes and other like occurrences. Nothing is more easy
than to refute these objections, for one cannot judge of the perfection
of ancient existence only by knowing its essence and nature, and we
deceive ourselves in thinking that a thing is more or less perfect, as
it pleases or displeases, is useful or useless to human nature; and to
close the mouths of those who ask why God has not created all men
without exception that they might be guided by the light of reason, it
is enough to say that it was because the material was not sufficient to
give each being the degree of perfection that was most suitable for
him, or to speak more proper, because the laws of nature were so ample
and extensive that they could suffice for the production of all things
of which an infinite understanding is capable.</p>

<p class="first">Until now we have fought the popular idea concerning
the Divinity, but we have not yet said what God is, and if we were
asked, we should say that the word represents to us an Infinite Being,
of whom one of his attributes is to be a substance of extent and
consequently eternal and infinite. The extent or the quantity not being
finite or divisible, it may be imagined that the matter was everywhere
the same, our understanding not distinguishing parts. For example,
water, as much as water is imagined, is divisible, and its parts
separable from one another, though as much as a <i>corporeal
substance</i> it is neither separable nor divisible.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2120src" href="#xd26e2120" name="xd26e2120src">1</a> Thus
neither matter or quantity have anything unworthy of God, for if all is
God, and all comes surely from his essence, it follows quite absolutely
that He is all that he contains, since it is incomprehensible that
Beings quite material should be contained in a Being who is not. That
we may not think that this is a new opinion, <i>Tertullian</i>, one of
the foremost men among the Christians, has pronounced against
<i>Apelles</i>, that, &ldquo;that which is not matter is
nothing,&rdquo; and against <i>Praxias</i>, that &ldquo;all substance
is matter,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53"

<p class="first">These sentiments are plain and the only ones that good
and sound judgment can form of God. However, there are but few who are
satisfied with such simplicity. Boorish people, who are accustomed to
adulation of opinion, demand a God who resembles earthly kings. The
pomp and circumstance surrounding them so fascinates, that to take away
all hope of going after death to increase the number of heavenly
courtiers enjoying the same pleasure which attaches to the Court of
Kings, is to take away the consolation and the only things which
prevent them from going to despair over the miseries of life. They want
a <i>just</i> and <i>avenging</i> God, who <i>rewards</i> and
<i>punishes</i> after the manner of kings, a God susceptible of all
human passions and weaknesses. They give him feet, hands, and ears, and
yet they do not regard a God so constituted as material. They say that
man is his masterpiece, and even his own image, but do not allow that
the copy is like the original. In a word, the God of the people of
today is subject to as many forms as Jupiter of the Pagans, and what is
still more strange, these follies contradict each other and shock good
sense. The vulgar reverence them because they firmly believe what the
Prophets have said, although these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54"
href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>visionaries among the Hebrews,
were the same as the augurs and the diviners among the pagans.<a class=

They consult the Bible as if God or nature was therein expounded to
them in a special manner, however this book is only a rhapsody of
fragments, gathered at various times, selected by several persons, and
given to the people according to the fancy of the Rabbins, who did not
publish them until after approving some, and rejecting others, and
seeing if they were conformable or opposed to the Law of
Moses.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2164src" href="#xd26e2164" name=
"xd26e2164src">4</a> Yes, such is the malice and stupidity of men that
they prefer to pass their lives disputing with one another, and
worshipping a book received from ignorant people; a book with little
order or method, which everyone admits as confused and badly conceived,
only serving to foment divisions.</p>
<p>Christians would rather adore this phantom than listen to the law of
Nature which God&mdash;that is to say, Nature, which is the active
principle&mdash;has written in the heart of man. All other laws are but
human fictions, and pure illusions forged, not by Demons or evil
spirits, which are fanciful ideas, but by the skill of Princes and
Ecclesiastics to give the former more warrant for their authority, and
to enrich the latter by the traffic in an infinity of chimeras which
sell to the ignorant at a good price.</p>
<p>All other laws are not supported save on the authority of the Bible,
in the original of which appear <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55"

extraordinary and impossible things,<a class="noteref" id=

speaks only of recompenses or punishments for good or bad actions, but
which are wisely deferred for a future life, relying that the trick
will not be discovered in this, no one having returned from the other
to tell the news. Thus, men kept ever wavering between hope and fear,
are held to their duty by the belief they aver that God has created man
only to render him eternally happy or unhappy, and which has given rise
to the infinity of religions which we are about to discuss.</p>

<p class="first">Before the word Religion was introduced in the world
mankind was only obliged to follow natural laws and to conform to
common sense. This instinct alone was the tie by which men were united,
and so very simple was this bond of unity, that nothing among them was
more rare than dissensions. But when fear created a suspicion that
there were Gods, and invisible powers, they raised altars to these
imaginary beings, so that in putting off the yoke of Nature and Reason,
which are the sources of true life, they subjected themselves by vain
ceremonies and superstitious worship to frivolous phantoms of the
imagination, and that is whence arose this word Religion which makes so
much noise in the world.</p>
<p>Men having admitted invisible forces which were all-powerful over
them, they worshipped them to appease them, and further imagined that
Nature was a being subordinate to this power, thence they had the idea
that it was a great mace that threatened, or a slave that acted only by
the order that such power gave him. Since this false idea had broken
their will they had only scorn for Nature, and respect only for those
pretended beings that they called their Gods. Thence came the ignorance
in which mankind was plunged, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href=
"#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>and from which the well-informed,
however deep the abyss, could have rescued them, if their zeal had not
been extinguished by those who led them blindly, and who lived by
imposture. But though there was but little appearance of success in the
enterprise, it was not necessary to abandon the party of truth, and
only in consideration of those who were afflicted with the symptoms of
so great an evil, were generous souls available to represent matters as
they were.</p>

men imbibed the notion that there were invisible agencies which were
the cause of their good and bad fortune, they lost their good sense and
reason substituting for their chimeras so many <i>Divinities</i> who
had care of their conduct.</p>
<p>After having forged these Gods they were curious to know of what
matter they consisted, and finally imagined that they should be of the
same substance as the soul. Then being persuaded that the latter
resembled the shadows which appear in a mirror, or during sleep, they
believed that some Gods were real substances but so thin and subtile
that to distinguish them from bodies they called them <i>Spirits</i>.
So that bodies and spirits were in effect the same thing, and differed
neither more nor less, and to be <i>both</i> corporeal and incorporeal
is a most incomprehensible thing. The reason given is that each spirit
has a proper form, and is included within some limit, that is to say
that it has some boundaries, and consequently must be a body however
thin and subtile it might be.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2214src" href=

<p class="first">The ignorant, that is, the greater part of mankind
having settled in this manner the substance of their Gods, tried also
to determine by what methods these invisible powers produced their
effects. Not being able to do this definitely by reason of their
ignorance, they put faith in their conjectures, blindly judging the
future by the past, while seeing neither cohesion nor dependence.</p>
<p>In all that they undertook they saw but the past, and foretold good
or evil for the future according as the same enterprise had at another
time turned out either good or bad. <i>Phormion</i> having defeated the

sent another <i>Scipio</i> to the same country against <i>Cesar</i>,

<p class="first">The founders of Religion having based their impostures
on the ignorance of the people, took great care to maintain them by the
<i>adoration of images</i> which they pretended were inhabited by the
<i>Gods</i>, and this caused a flood of gold and benefactions called
holy things, to pour into the coffers of the priests. These gifts were
regarded as sacred, and designed for the use of these holy ministers,
and none were so audacious as to pretend to their office, or even to
touch them. To allure the people more successfully, these priests made
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=

by the commerce which they boasted of having with the Gods. There is
nothing so natural as to know destiny. These impostors were too well
informed to omit any circumstance so advantageous for their designs.
Some were established at <i>Delos</i>, others at <i>Delphos</i> and
elsewhere, where by ambiguous oracles they replied to the demands made
of them. Women even were engaged in these impostures, and the Romans in
their great <i>Calamities</i> had recourse to the <i>Sybilline

who pretended to converse with the dead were called

<p class="first">The ambitious, who have always been grand masters of
the art of trickery, have always followed this method in expounding
their laws, and to oblige the people to submit to them they have
persuaded them that they had received them either from a <i>God</i> or
a <i>Goddess</i>.</p>
<p>Although there was a multitude of Divinities, those who worshipped
them called <i>Pagans</i> had no general system of Religion. Each
republic, each state and city, each particular place had its own rites
and thought of the Divinity as fancy dictated. Following this came
legislators more cunning than these first tricksters, and who employed
methods more studied and more certain for the propagation and
perpetuity of their laws, as well as the culture of such ceremonies and
fanaticism as they deemed proper to establish.</p>
<p>Among the great number Arabia and its frontiers has given birth to
three who have been distinguished as much by the kind of laws and
worship which they established, as by the idea they have given of a
Divinity to their followers, and the means they have taken to cause
this idea to be received and their laws to be approved.</p>

<p class="first">The celebrated <i>Moses</i>, grandson of a great
magician,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2528src" href="#xd26e2528" name=
"xd26e2528src">1</a> by the account of <i>Justin Martyr</i>, had all
the advantages proper for what he afterwards became. It is well known
that the Hebrews, of whom he became the Chief, were a nation of
shepherds whom King Pharaoh Orus I. received in his country in
consideration of services that he had received from one of them in the
time of a great famine. He gave them some lands in the east of Egypt in
a country fertile in pasturage, and consequently adapted for their
flocks.</p>
<p>During 200 years they rapidly increased, because, being considered
foreigners they were not required to serve in the armies of Pharaoh,
and because of the natural advantages of the lands which <i>Orus</i>
had granted them. Some bands of Arabs came to join them as brothers,
for they were of a similar race, and they increased so astonishingly
that the land of Goshen not being able to contain them they spread all
over Egypt, giving Pharaoh Memnon II. good reason to fear that they
might be capable of some dangerous attempt in case Egypt was attacked
(as happened soon after) by their active enemies, the Ethiopians.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thus a policy of state compelled this Prince to curtail their
privileges, and to seek means to weaken and enslave them. Pharaoh Orus
II. surnamed <i>Busiris</i> because of his cruelty, and who succeeded
<i>Memnon</i>, followed his plan regarding the Jews. Wishing to
perpetuate his memory by the erection of the Pyramids and building the
city of Thebes, he condemned the Hebrews to labor at making bricks, the
material in the earth of their country being adapted for this purpose.
During this servitude the celebrated <i>Moses</i> was born, in the same
year that the King issued an edict to cast all the male Hebrew children
into the Nile, seeing that he had no surer means of exterminating this
rabble of foreigners.</p>
<p>Moses was exposed to perish in the waters in a basket covered with
pitch, which his mother placed in the rushes on the banks of the river.
It chanced that <i>Thermitis</i>, daughter of <i>Orus</i>, was walking
near the shore and hearing the cries of the child, the natural
compassion of her sex inspired her to save it.</p>
<p>Orus having died, Thermitis succeeded him, and Moses having been
presented to her, she caused him to be educated in a manner befitting
the son of a Queen of the wisest and most polished nation of the
universe. In a word he was <i>tutored in all the science of the
Egyptians</i>, and it is admitted, and they have represented Moses to
us as the greatest politician, the wisest philosopher and the most
famous <i>magician</i> of his time. It followed that he was admitted to
the order of Priesthood, which was in Egypt what the <i>Druids</i> were
in Gaul, that is to say&mdash;<i>everything</i>.</p>
<p>Those who are not familiar with what the government of Egypt was,
will be pleased to know that the famous dynasties having come to an
end, the entire <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>country was dependent upon one Sovereign who
divided it into several provinces of no great extent. The governors of
these countries were called <i>monarchs</i>, and they were ordinarily
of the powerful order of Priests, who possessed nearly one-third of
Egypt. The king named these <i>monarchs</i>, and if we can believe the
authors who have written of Moses and compare what they have said with
what Moses himself has written, we may conclude that he was
<i>monarch</i> of the land of <i>Goshen</i>, and that he owed his
elevation to Thermitis, who had also saved his life.</p>
<p>We see what Moses was in Egypt, where he had both time and means to
study the manners of the Egyptians, and those of his nation: their
governing passions, their inclinations, and all that would be of
service to him in his effort to excite the revolution of which he was
the promoter.</p>
<p>Thermitis having died, her successor renewed the persecution against
the Hebrews, and <i>Moses</i> having lost his previous favor, and
fearing that he could not justify several homicides that he had
committed, took the precaution to flee.</p>
<p>He retired to <i>Arabia Petrea</i>, on the confines of Egypt, and
chance brought him to the home of a tribal chief of the country. His
services, and the talents that his master remarked in him, merited his
good graces and one of his daughters in marriage. It is here to be
noted that Moses was such a bad Jew, and knew so little of the
<i>redoubtable God</i> whom he invented later, that he wedded an
idolatress, and did not even think of having his children
circumcised.</p>
<p>It was in the Arabian deserts, while guarding the flocks of his
father-in-law and brother-in-law, he conceived the design of avenging
the injustice which had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href=
"#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>been done him by the King of Egypt,
by bringing trouble and sedition in the court of his states; and he
flattered himself that he could easily succeed in this by reason of his
talents, as by the disposition which he knew he would find in his
nation already incensed against the government by reason of the bad
treatment that they had been caused to suffer.</p>
<p>It appears by the history which he has told of this revolution, or
at least by the author of the books attributed to Moses, that
<i>Jethro</i>, his brother-in-law, was in the conspiracy, as well as
his brother <i>Aaron</i> and his sister <i>Mary</i>, who had remained
in Egypt, and with whom he could arrange to hold correspondence. As may
be seen by the sequel he had formed a vast plan in good politics, and
he could put in service against <i>Egypt</i> all the science he had
learned there, and the pretended <i>Magic</i> in which he was more
subtle and skillful than all those at the Court of Pharaoh who
possessed the same accomplishments. It was by these pretended miracles
that he gained the confidence of those of his nation that he caused to
rebel. He joined to them thousands of mutinous Egyptians, Ethiopians
and Arabs. Boasting the power of his <i>Divinity</i> and the frequent
interviews he held with Him, and causing Him to intervene in all the
measures he took with the chiefs of the revolt, he persuaded them so
well that they followed him to the number of 600,000
combatants&mdash;besides the women and children&mdash;across the
deserts of Arabia, of which he knew all the windings.</p>
<p>After a <i>six</i> days march on a laborious retreat, he commanded
his followers to consecrate the <i>seventh</i> to his God by a
<i>public rest</i>, to make them believe that this God favored him,
that he approved his sway, and that no one could have the audacity to
contradict him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span></p>
<p>There were never any people more ignorant than the Hebrews, and
consequently none more credulous. To be convinced of this profound
ignorance, it is only necessary to recall the condition of these people
in Egypt when <i>Moses</i> made them revolt. They were hated by the
Egyptians because of their pastoral life, persecuted by the Sovereign
and employed in the vilest labor.</p>
<p>Among such a populace it was not very difficult for Moses to avail
himself of his talents. He made them believe that his God (whom he
sometimes simply called an <i>angel</i>)&mdash;the <i>God of their
Fathers</i>&mdash;appeared to him, that it was by his order that he
took care to lead them, that he had chosen him for Governor, and that
they would be the favored people of this God, provided they believed
what he said on his part.</p>
<p>He added to his exhortations on the part of his God, the adroit use
of his prestige, and the knowledge that he had of nature. He confirmed
what he said to them by what might be called <i>miracles</i>, always
easy to perform, and which made a great impression on an imbecile
populace.</p>
<p>It may be remarked above all, that he believed he had found a sure
method for holding this people submissive to his orders, in making
accessory of the statement that God himself was their leader: by night
a <i>column of fire</i> and a <i>cloud</i> by day. But it can be proved
that this was the grossest trick of this impostor, and that it might
serve him for a long time. He had learned during his travels that he
had made in Arabia, a country vast and uninhabited, that it was the
custom of those who traveled in companies to take guides who conducted
them in the night by means of a brazier, the flame of which they
followed, and in the day time by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68"
href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>the smoke of the same brazier
which all the members of the caravan could see, and consequently not go
astray. This custom prevailed among the <i>Medes</i> and
<i>Assyrians</i>, and it is quite natural that Moses used it, and made
it pass for a <i>miracle</i>, and a mark of the protection of his God.
If I may not be believed when I say that this was a trick, let Moses
himself be believed, who in <a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=num%2010:29-33&amp;version=NRSV">
Numbers, Chap. x. v. 29&ndash;33</a>, asks his brother-in-law, Hobab,
to come with the Israelites, <i>that he may show them the roads,
because he knew the country</i>. This is demonstrative, for if it was
God who marched before Israel night and day in the <i>cloud</i> and the
<i>column of fire</i> could they have a better guide? Meanwhile here is
Moses exhorting his brother-in-law by the most pressing motives of
interest to serve him as <i>Guide</i>. Then the <i>cloud</i> and the
<i>column of fire</i> was God only for the people, and not for Moses,
who knew what it was.</p>
<p>These poor unfortunates thus seduced, charmed at being adopted by
the Master of God, as they were told, emerging from a hard and cruel
bondage, applauded Moses and swore to obey him. His authority was thus
confirmed. He sought to perpetuate it, and under pretext of
establishing divine worship, or of a supreme God of whom he said he was
the lieutenant, he made his brother and his children chiefs of the
Royal Palace, that is to say, of the place where miracles were
performed out of the sight and presence of the people.</p>
<p>So he continued these pretended miracles, at which the simple were
amazed and others stupefied, but which caused those who were wise and
who saw through these impostures to pity them. However skillful Moses
was, and how many clever tricks he knew how to do, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>he would
have had much trouble to secure obedience if he had not a strong
army.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2708src" href="#xd26e2708" name=
"xd26e2708src">2</a> Deceit without force has rarely succeeded.</p>
<p>It was in order to have assured means to maintain obedience against
the discerning that he continued to place in his own faction those of
his tribe, giving them all the important charges and exempting them
from the greater part of the labors. He knew how to create jealousies
among the other tribes, some of whom took his part against the others.
Finally assuring adroitly to his interest those who appeared the most
enlightened, by placing them in his confidence, he secured them by
giving them employment of distinction.</p>
<p>After that he found some of these idiots had the courage to reproach
his bad faith; that under his false pretense of justice and equity he
was seizing everything. As the sovereign authority was vested in his
blood in such manner that no one had a right to aspire to it, they
considered finally that he was less their father than their tyrant.</p>
<p>On such occasions Moses by cunning policy confounded these
<i>free-thinkers</i> and spared none who censured his government.</p>
<p>With such precautions, and cloaking his punishments under the name
of <i>Divine</i> vengeance, he continued absolute, and to finish in the
same way he began, that is to say by deceit and imposture, he chose an
extraordinary death. He cast himself in an abyss in a lonely place
where he retired from time to time under pretext of conferring with
God, and which he had long <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href=
"#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>designed for his tomb. His body never
having been found, it was believed that his God had taken him, and that
he had become like Him.</p>
<p>He knew that the memories of the patriarchs who preceded him were
held in great veneration when their sepulchres were found, but that was
not sufficient for an ambition like his. He must be revered as a God
for whom death had no terrors, and to this end all his efforts were
directed since the beginning of his reign when he said that he was
established of God&mdash;to be the <i>God of Pharaoh</i>.

<p class="first"><i>Jesus Christ</i>, who was not unacquainted with the
maxims and science of the Egyptians, among whom he dwelt several years,
availed himself of this knowledge, deeming it proper for the design
which he meditated. Considering that Moses was renowned because he
commanded an ignorant people, he undertook to build on a similar
foundation, and his followers were only some idiots whom he persuaded
that the Holy Spirit was his Father, and his Mother a Virgin.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2822src" href="#xd26e2822" name="xd26e2822src">1</a>
These good people being accustomed to be satisfied with dreams and
fancies, adopted this fable, believed all that he wished, and even more
willingly that a birth out of the natural order was not so marvelous a
circumstance for them to believe. To be born of a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=

Spirit</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e2859src" href="#xd26e2859" name=
"xd26e2859src">2</a> was, in their estimation, as wonderful as what the
Romans said of their founder, <i>Romulus</i>, who owed his birth to a
<i>Vestal</i> and a <i>God</i>.</p>
<p>This happened at a time when the Jews were tired of their God, as
they had been of their Judges,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2914src"
href="#xd26e2914" name="xd26e2914src">3</a> and wished to have a
visible God like other nations. As the number of fools is infinite, he
found followers everywhere, but his extreme poverty was an invincible
obstacle to his elevation. The <i>Pharisees</i>, delighted with the
boldness of a man of their sect,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2923src"
href="#xd26e2923" name="xd26e2923src">4</a> while startled at his
audacity, elevated or depressed him according to the fickle humor of
the populace, so that when it became noised about concerning his
<i>Divinity</i>, it was impossible&mdash;he being possessed of no
power&mdash;that his design could succeed. No matter how many sick he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=

money and no army, he could not fail to perish, and with that outlook
it appears that he had less chance of success than <i>Moses</i>,
<i>Mahomet</i>, and all those who were ambitious to elevate themselves
above others. If he was more unfortunate, he was no less adroit, and
several places in his history give evidence that the greatest fault in
his policy was not to have sufficiently provided for his own safety. So
it may be seen that he did not manage his affairs any better than those
two other legislators, of whose memory exists but the remains of the
belief that they established among the different nations.</p>

a little hamlet in Judea, and that his mother was a poor villager who
only existed by her labor. Having been convicted of adultery with a
soldier named <i>Pandira</i>, she was induced to flee by her betrothed,
who was a carpenter by trade, who condoned their offence, and they
wandered miserably from place to place. She was secretly delivered of
Jesus, and finding themselves in want, they were constrained to flee to
Egypt. After several years, his services being of no value to the
Egyptians, he returned to his own country, where, quite proud of the
miracles he knew how to perform, he proclaimed himself <i>God</i>.</p>

destroyer of the ancient law and the founder of the new. Such were the
origins of the new religion which was built on the ruins of the old, or
to speak disinterestedly, there was nothing more divine in this than in
the other sects which preceded it. Its founder, who <span class=

quite ignorant, seeing the extreme corruption of the Jewish republic,
judged it as nearing its end, and believed that another should be

ambitious than himself, made him haste to establish it by methods quite
opposed to those of Moses. The latter commenced by making himself
formidable to other nations. Jesus, on the contrary, attracted them to
him by the hope of the advantages of another life, which he said could
be obtained by believing in him, while Moses only promised temporal
benefits as a recompense for the observation of <i>his</i> law. Jesus
Christ held out a hope which never was realized. The laws of one only
regarded the exterior, while those of the other aimed at the inner man,
influencing even the thoughts, and entirely the reverse of the law of
Moses. Whence it follows that Jesus believed with <i>Aristotle</i> that
it is with Religion and States, as with individuals who are begotten
and die, and as nothing is made except subject to dissolution, there is
no law which can follow which is entirely opposed to it. Now as it is
difficult to decide to change from one law to another, and as the great
majority is difficult to move in matters of Religion, Jesus, in
imitation of the other innovators had recourse to <i>miracles</i>,
which have always been the peril of the ignorant, and the sanctuary of
the ambitious.</p>

a successor who resembled him. That is to say, a <i>Messiah</i>, grand

<p class="first">As for his <i>Morals</i>, we see nothing more divine
therein than in the writings of the ancients, or rather we find only
what are only extracts or imitations. <i>St. Augustin</i> (ch. 9 and v.
20 of the Confessions, Book 7,) even admits that he has found in some
of their works nearly all of the beginning of the Gospel according to
<i>St. John</i>. As far as may be seen, that Apostle is believed, in
many places, to have stolen from other authors, and that it was not
difficult to rob the Prophets of their enigmas and visions to make his
<i>Apocalypse</i>. Whence comes the conformity which we find between
the doctrine of the Old Testament and that of <i>Plato</i>? to say
nothing of what the Rabbins have done, and those who have fabricated
the <i>Holy Writings</i> from a mass of fragments stolen from this
Grand Philosopher.</p>
<p>Certainly the birth of the world has a thousand times more
probability in his <i>Timaeus</i> than in Genesis, and it cannot be
said that that comes from what <i>Plato</i> had <i>read</i> in the
books of the Jews during his travels in Egypt, for according to <i>St.
Augustin</i> himself, (Confessions, Book 7, ch. 9, v. 20,)
<i>Ptolemy</i> had not yet translated them. The description of the
country of which <i>Socrates</i> speaks to <i>Simias</i> in the
<i>Phaedon</i> (<i>?</i>) has infinitely more grace than the
<i>Terrestrial Paradise</i> (of Eden) and the
<i>Androgynus</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e3225src" href="#xd26e3225"

conceived than what <i>Genesis</i> says of the extraction of Eve from
one of the sides of Adam. Is there anything that more resembles the two
accidents of <i>Sodom</i> and <i>Gomorrah</i> than that which happened
to <i>Phaeton</i>? Is there anything more alike than the fall of
<i>Lucifer</i> and that of <i>Vulcan</i>, or that of the giants cast
down by the lightnings of Jupiter? Anything more similar than
<i>Samson</i> and <i>Hercules</i>, <i>Elijah</i> and <i>Phaeton</i>,
<i>Joseph</i> and <i>Hippolitus</i>, <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> and
<i>Lycaon</i>, <i>Tantalus</i> and the tormented rich man (<a class=

the Gods</i>? <i>St. Augustin</i>&mdash;quoted from God, Book 6, chap.
14,&mdash;<i>St. Cyrile</i> and <i>Theophylactus</i> compare
<i>Jonah</i> with <i>Hercules</i>, surnamed <i>Trinsitium</i>
(?Trinoctius), because he had dwelt three days and three nights in the
belly of a whale. The <i>river of Daniel</i>, spoken of in the
<i>Prophets</i>, ch. vii, is a visible imitation of
<i>Periphlegeton</i>, which is mentioned by Plato in the Dialogue on
the &ldquo;Immortality of the Soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Original sin</i> has been taken from <i>Pandora&rsquo;s box</i>,
the sacrifice of <i>Isaac</i> and <i>Jephthah</i> from the story of
<i>Iphigenia</i>, although in the latter a <i>hind</i> was substituted.
What is said of <i>Lot and his wife</i> is quite like the tale which is
told of <i>Baucis</i> and <i>Philemon</i>. In short, it is
unquestionable that the authors of the Scriptures have transcribed word
for word the works of <i>Hesiod</i> and <i>Homer</i>.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But it seems that I have made quite a digression
which, however, may not be unprofitable. Let us return then to Jesus,
or rather, to his <i>Morals</i>.</p>
<p><i>Celsus</i> proves, by the account of <i>Origen</i> (Book VI,
against <i>Celsus</i>), that he had taken from <i>Plato</i> his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>finest sentiments, such as that which says
(<i>Luke</i>, c. xviii, v. 25), <i>that a camel might sooner pass
through the eye of a needle than a rich man should enter the Kingdom of
God</i>. It was the <i>sect of Pharisees</i> of which he was, and who
believed in him, which gave birth to this. What is said of the
<i>Immortality of the Soul</i>, of the <i>Resurrection</i>, of
<i>Hell</i>, and the greater part of his <i>Morals</i>, I see nothing
more admirable than in the works of <i>Epictetus</i>, <i>Epicurus</i>
and many others. In fact, the latter was cited by <i>St. Jerome</i>
(Book VIII, against <i>Jovian</i>, ch. viii), <i>as a man whose virtue
puts to the blush better Christians, observing that all his works were
filled with but herbs, fruits and abstinence, and whose delights were
so temperate that his finest repasts were but a little cheese, bread
and water</i>. With a life so frugal, this Philosopher, pagan as he
was, said that it was <i>better to be unlucky and rational, than rich
and opulent without having good sense</i>, adding, <i>that it is rare
that fortune and wisdom are found in the same individual</i>, and
<i>that one could have no knowledge of happiness nor live with pleasure
unless felicity was accompanied by prudence, justice and honesty, which
are qualifications of a true and lasting delight</i>.</p>
<p>As for <i>Epictetus</i> I do not believe that any man, not excepting
<i>Jesus</i> himself, was more austere, more firm, more equitable, or
more moral. I say nothing but what is easy to prove, and not to pass my
prescribed limit I will not mention all the exemplary acts of his life,
but give one single example of constancy which puts to shame the
weakness and cowardice of <i>Jesus</i> in the sight of death. Being a
slave to a freeman named <i>Epaphroditus</i>, captain of the guards of
Nero, it took the fancy of this brute to twist the leg of Epictetus.
Epictetus perceiving that it gave him pleasure said to him, smiling,
that he was well convinced that the game <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>would not end until he
had broken his leg; in fact, this crisis happened. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
said Epictetus with an even smiling face, &ldquo;did I not say that you
would break my leg?&rdquo; Was there ever courage equal to that? and
could it have been said of <i>Jesus Christ</i> had he been the victim?
He who wept and trembled with fear at the least alarm, and who evinced
at his death a lack of spirit that never was witnessed in the majority
of his martyrs.</p>
<p>I doubt not but what it might be said of this action of
<i>Epictetus</i> what the ignorant remark of the virtues of the
Philosophers, that vanity was their principle, and that they were not
what they seemed. But I say also that those who use such language are
people who, in the pulpit, say all that comes into their
heads&mdash;either good or evil&mdash;and they want the privilege of
telling it all. I know also that when these babblers, sellers of air,
wind and smoke, have vented all their strength against the champions of
common sense they think they have well earned the revenues of their
livings: that they have not merited a call to instruct the people
unless they have declared against those who know what common sense and
true virtue is.</p>
<p>So it is true that nothing in the world approaches so little to the
manners of true scholars as the actions of the ignorant who decry them
and who appear to have studied only to procure preferment which gives
them bread; and which preferment they worship and magnify when this
height is attained, as if they had reached a condition of perfection,
which, to those who succeed, is a condition of self-love, ease, pride
and pleasure, following nothing less than the maxims of the religion
which they profess.</p>
<p>But let us leave these people who know not what virtue is, and
examine the divinity of their Master. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">After having examined his policy and morals we have
seen nothing more Divine than in the writings and conduct of the
ancients. Let us see if the reputation which followed him after his
death is an evidence that he was God. Mankind is so accustomed to false
reasoning that I am astonished that any one can reach a sane conclusion
from their conduct. Experience shows that there is nothing they
followed that is in any wise true, and that nothing has been done or
said by them which gives any evidence of stability. In the meanwhile it
is certain that common opinions are continually surrounded with
chimeras notwithstanding the efforts of the learned, which have always
opposed them. Whatever care has been taken to extirpate follies the
people have never abandoned them only after having been surfeited with
them. Moses was proud to boast himself the Lieutenant of the Lord of
Lords, and to prove his mission by extraordinary signs. If ever so
little he absented himself (which he did from time to time to confer,
as he said, with his God, as <i>Numa</i> and other lawgivers also did)
he only found on his return traces of the worship of the Gods which the
Israelites had seen in Egypt. He successfully held them forty years in
the wilderness that they might lose the idea of those they had
abandoned, and not being yet satisfied they obeyed him who led them,
and bore firmly whatever hardship they were caused to suffer in this
regard. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span></p>
<p>Only the hatred which they had conceived for other nations, by an
arrogance of which most idiots are susceptible, made them insensibly
forget the Gods of Egypt and attach themselves to those of <i>Moses</i>
whom they adored, and sometimes with all the circumstance marked in the
laws. But when they quitted these conditions little by little to follow
those of <i>Jesus Christ</i>, I cannot see what inconstancy caused them
to run after the novelty and change.</p>

<p class="first">The most ignorant Hebrews having given the most vogue
to the law of Moses were the first to run after Jesus, and as their
number was infinite and they encouraged each other, it is not
marvellous that these errors spread so easily. It is not that novelty
does not always beget suffering, but it is the glory that is expected
that one hopes will smooth the difficulties. Thus the Disciples of
Jesus, miserable as they were, reduced at times to nourish themselves
with grains of corn which they gathered from the fields (Luke vi., 1),
and seeing themselves shamefully excluded from places where they
thought to enter to ease their fatigue (Luke ix., 52&ndash;53) they
began to be discouraged with living; their Master being without the
pale of the law and unable to give them the benefits, glory and
grandeur which he had promised them.</p>
<p>After his death his disciples, in despair at seeing their hopes
frustrated, and pursued by the Jews who wished to treat them as they
had treated their Master, made a virtue of necessity and scattered over
the country, where by the report of some women (<a class=
"biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jn%2020:18&amp;version=NRSV">John
xx, 18</a>) they told of his resurrection, his divine affiliation and
the rest of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>the fables with which the Gospels are
filled.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3487src" href="#xd26e3487" name=
"xd26e3487src">1</a> The trouble which they had to make progress among
the <i>Jews</i> made them resolve to pass among the <i>Gentiles</i>,
and try to serve themselves better among them; but as it was necessary
to have more learning for that than they possessed&mdash;the Gentiles
being philosophers and too much in love with truth to resort to
trifles&mdash;they gained over a young man (Saul or St. Paul) of an
active and eager mind and a little better informed than the simple
fishermen or than the greater babblers who associated with them. A
stroke from Heaven made him blind, as is said (without this the trick
would have been useless) and this incident for a time attracted some
weak souls.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3503src" href="#xd26e3503" name=
"xd26e3503src">2</a> By the fear of Hell, taken from some of the fables
of the ancient poets, and by the hope of a glorious <i>Resurrection</i>
and a <i>Paradise</i> which is hardly more supportable than that of
<i>Mahomet</i>; all these procured for their <i>Master</i> the honor of
passing for a God, which he himself was unable to obtain while living.
In which this kind of <i>Jesus</i> was no better than <i>Homer</i>: six
cities which had driven the latter out with contempt and scorn during
his life, disputed with each other after his death to determine with
whom remained the honor of having been his birth-place.</p>
<p>By this it may be seen that Christianity depends, like all other
things, on the caprice of men, in whose opinion all passes either for
good or bad, according as the notion strikes them. Further, if Jesus
was God, nothing could resist him, for St. Paul (Romans, v. 19), is
witness that nothing could overcome his will. Yet <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>this
passage is directly opposed to another in Genesis (iv, 7), where it is
said that as the <i>desires and appetites of man belong to him, who is
the Master</i>, so it is agreed to accord free-will to the master of
animals, that is to say, man, for whom it is said God has created the
universe.</p>
<p>But without wandering in a maze of errors and positive
contradictions, of which we have discoursed sufficiently, let us say
something of <i>Mahomet</i>, who founded a law upon maxims totally
opposed to those of <i>Jesus Christ</i>.</p>

<p class="first">Hardly had the Disciples of Jesus abandoned the Mosaic
law to introduce the Christian, than mankind, with their usual caprice
and ordinary inconstancy, suddenly changed their sentiments, and all
the East was seen embracing the sentiments of the celebrated
<i>Arius</i>, who had the boldness to oppose the fable of Jesus, and
prove that he was no more a God than any other man. Thus Christianity
was almost abolished, and there appeared a new law-giver, who, in less

<p>To be well acquainted with him, it must be known that the part of

worshipped the Idols of the country. As Chief of his Tribe he was
Prince of this country in which quality he had sustained the war
against the King of Persia and the Emperor of Ethiopia, which shows
that <i>Mahomet</i> was not of the riff-raff of the people.</p>
<p>His father dying before his grandfather, his tender years caused him
to lose the rights he had to the Sovereignty, which one of his uncles
usurped. It was for this reason, not being able to succeed to the title
of Prince, that he was reduced to the humble condition of shop-boy in
the employ of a wealthy widow for whom he became afterwards factor.
Having found him to her liking she married him and made him one of the
richest citizens of Mecca. He was then about <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>30 years
of age, and seeing at hand the means to enforce his rights, his
ambitions awakened, and he meditated in what manner he could
re-establish himself in the dignity of his grandfather.</p>
<p>The correspondence that he had had with <i>Christians</i> in
<i>Egypt</i> and <i>Jews</i> in <i>Judea</i>, where he had traded a
long time for his wife while he was only her factor, gave him an
opportunity of knowing who Moses was and also Jesus Christ. He also had
remarked into how many different sects their Religion was divided, and
which produced such diversity of opinions, and the zeal of each sect.
By this he profited, and he believed he could better succeed in the
interest of establishing a new Religion. The conditions of the time
when he formed this design were very favorable to him, for nearly all
of the Arabs, disgusted with the worship of their Idols, were fallen
into a species of <i>Atheism</i>. Thus Mahomet began by leading a
retired life, being exemplary, seeking solitude, and passing the
greater part of the day in prayers and meditations. He caused himself
to be admired for his modest demeanor, and commenced to speak of
revelations and visions. By such action is gained the credence of the
populace, and by such methods Moses and Jesus commenced. He called
himself a prophet and an envoy of God, and having as much skill as his
predecessors in working miracles, he soon gained attention, then
admiration, and soon after the confidence of the people. A <i>Jew</i>
and a <i>Christian monk</i> who were in his conspiracy aided him in his
dextrous moves, and he soon became powerful enough to resist a
<i>vigorous man</i> named <i>Corais</i>, a learned Arab, who endeavored
to expose his imposture.</p>
<p>During this time his uncle, the governor of Mecca, died, and not
being yet strong enough to assume the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>authority of sovereign,
he was obliged to yield to one of his kinsmen who, penetrating his
designs, obliged him to flee from <i>Mecca</i> and take refuge at
<i>Medina</i>, where one party in the city who were Arian Christians
joined him.</p>
<p>Then he ceased to support his authority by argument, and persuaded
his disciples to plant the Mussulman faith at the point of the sword.
Having strengthened his party by alliances, marrying his daughters to
four of the principal citizens of <i>Medina</i>, he was in condition to
place armies in the field who subjugated the various tribes, one after
the other, and with whom he finally seized <i>Mecca</i>. He did not die
until after he had accomplished his purpose by his hypocrisy and
imposture, which elevated him to the dignity of sovereign, which he
transmitted to his successors, and his faith so well established that
there has been no evidence of its failure for six hundred years, and
yet it may be upon the eve of its destruction.</p>

After having labored during twenty-three years in the establishment of
his Law and Religion, he saw its progress before his death, and having
an assurance which Jesus Christ had not, that it would exist a long
time after his death, since he prudently accommodated the genius and
passions of his followers.</p>
<p>Such was the last of these three impostors. Moses threw himself into
an abyss by an excess of ambition to cause himself to be believed
immortal. Jesus Christ was ignominiously hung up between two thieves,
being covered with shame as a recompense for his imposture, and lastly,
Mahomet died in reality in his own bed, and <span class=

of the celebrated <i>Golius</i> having asked what the <i>Mahometans</i>
said of their prophet, this wise professor sent him the following
extract which contains an abridgement of the life of that Impostor
taken from a manuscript in the Turkish language: &ldquo;The Lord
<i>Mahomet Mustapha</i>, of glorious memory, the greatest of the
Prophets, was born in the fortieth year of the Empire of <i>Anal
Schirwan</i>, the Just. His holy nativity happened the twelfth day in
the second third of the month Rabia. Now, after the fortieth year of
his age had passed, he was divinely inspired, received the crown of
prophecy and the robe of Legation, which were brought him from God by
the faithful messenger Gabriel, with instructions to call mankind to
<i>Islamism</i>. After this inspiration from God was received, he dwelt
at <i>Mecca</i> for thirteen years. He left there aged fifty-three
years the eighth day of the month <i>Rabia</i>, which was a Friday, and
took refuge at <i>Medina</i>. Now, it was there, after his retreat the
twentieth day of the eleventh month, and the sixty-third year of his
blessed life, he succeeded to the enjoyment of the divine presence.
Some say that he was born while <i>Abelaka</i>,<a class="pseudonoteref"
href="#n89.1">2</a> his father, was yet living, others say after his
death. Lady <i>Amina</i>, a daughter of the <i>Wahabees</i>, gave him
for nurse lady <i>Halima</i>, of the tribe of <i>Beni-Saad</i>. <i>Abdo
Imutalib</i>,<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n89.1">2</a> his
grandfather, gave him the blessed name of <i>Mahomet</i>. He had four
sons and four daughters. The sons were <i>Kasim</i>, <i>Ibrahim</i>,
<i>Thajib</i> and <i>Thahir</i>, and the daughters, <i>Fatima</i>,
<i>Omokeltum</i>, <i>Rakia</i> and <i>Zeineb</i>. The companions of

remarked that it is the most subtile and fine part of the blood, which
is separated from it in the brain and is distributed by the nerves: so
that the source of the Soul is the heart where it is produced, and the
place where it performs its noblest function is the Brain, because
there it is well purified from the grosser parts of the blood. These

<i>particular souls</i> of animals are portions of the <i>universal

<p class="first">These philosophers believed the animated universe a
substance, spiritual, immortal and invisible, pursuing always that
which attracts, which is the source of all movements, and of all Souls
which are small particles of it. Now, as Souls are very pure, and
infinitely superior to the body, they do not unite immediately, but by
means of a subtile body, such as flame, or that subtile and extensive
air which the vulgar take for heaven. Afterwards they take a body less
subtile, then another a little more impure, and always thus by degrees,
until they can unite with the sensible bodies of animals, whence
(<i>sic</i>) they descend like into dungeons or sepulchres. The death
of the body, they say, is the life of the soul wherein it was buried,
and where it exercises but weakly its most beautiful functions.</p>
<p>Thus at the death of the body the soul comes out of its prison
untrammelled by matter, and reunites with the soul of the universe,
from whence it came. Thus, following this thought, all the Souls of
animals are of the same nature, and the diversity of their functions
comes only from the difference in the bodies that they enter.</p>
<p><i>Aristotle</i> admits further, a universal understanding common to
all beings, and which acts in regard to particular intelligences as
light does in regard to the eyes; and as light makes objects visible,
the universal understanding makes objects intelligible. This
philosopher <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=

feel, think and move, but he does not say what the Being is that is the
source and principle of these noble functions, and consequently we must
not look to him to dispel the doubt which exists concerning the Nature
of the Soul.</p>

<p class="first"><i>Dicearchus</i>, <i>Asclesiade</i> (? Esculapius),
and in some ways <i>Galen</i>, have also believed the soul to be
incorporeal, but in another manner, for they have said that it is
nothing more than the harmony of all parts of the body, that is to say,
that which results in an exact blending and disposition of the humors
and spirits. Thus, they say, health is not a part of him who is well,
however it be his condition, so that, however, the soul be in the
animal, it is not one of its parts, but a mutual accord of all of which
it is composed. On which it is remarked that these authors believe the
soul to be incorporeal, on a principle quite opposed to their intent,
by saying that it is <i>not</i> a body, but only something inseparably
attached <i>to</i> a body, that is to say, in good reasoning, that it
is quite corporeal, since corporeality is not only that which <i>is</i>
a body, but <i>all</i> which is <i>form</i> or <i>accident</i> that
cannot be separated from matter.</p>

<p class="first">Not to shuffle, as all these philosophers have done,
and to have as perfect an idea as is possible of the souls of animals,
let us admit that in all, without excepting man, it is of the same
nature, and has no different functions, but by reason of the diversity
of organs and humors; hence we must believe what follows.</p>
<p>It is certain that there is in the universe a very subtile spirit,
or a very delicate matter, and always in motion, the source of which is
in the <i>Sun</i>, and the remainder is spread in all the other bodies,
more or less, according to Nature or their consistency. That is the
Soul of the Universe which governs and vivifies it, and of which some
portion is distributed among all the parts that compose it. This Soul,
and the most pure Fire which is in the universe does not burn of
itself, but by the different movements that it gives to the particles
of other bodies where it enters, it burns and reflects its heat. The
visible fire has more of this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100"
href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>spirit than air, the latter
more than water, and the earth much less than the latter. Among the
mixed bodies, plants have more than minerals, and animals more than
either. To conclude, this fire being enclosed in the body, it is
rendered capable of thought, and that is what is called the soul, or
what is called animal spirits, which are spread in all parts of the
body. Now, it is certain that this soul being of the same nature in all
animals, disperses at the death of man in the same manner as in other
animals, from whence it follows that what Poets and Theologians sing or
preach of the other world, is a chimera which they have invented, and
which they narrate for reasons that are easy to guess.</p>

called them <i>immaterial</i>, <i>incorporeal</i>, forms without

either colored or defined, adding that they could cover themselves with

Greeks. They used them as effectively as the other peoples but with
this difference, they did not call them <i>Demons</i> like the Greeks,
but <i>good</i> and <i>bad</i> spirits; reserving for the <i>good
Demons</i> the name of <i>Spirit of God</i>, and calling those
<i>Prophets</i> who were said to possess this good spirit called the
Divine, which they held as responsible for great blessings, and
<i>cacodaemons</i> or <i>Evil spirits</i> on the contrary those which
were provocative of <i>great Evil</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">This distinction of good and evil made them name as
<i>Demoniacs</i> those whom we call lunatics, visionaries, madmen and
epileptics, and those who spoke to them in an unknown tongue. A man
ill-shaped and of evil look was to their notion possessed of an
<i>unclean spirit</i>, and a mute of a <i>dumb spirit</i>. Now, these
words <i>spirit</i> and <i>demon</i> became so familiar to them that
they spoke of them on all occasions, so that it is evident that the
Jews believed like the Greeks, that these phantoms were not mere
chimeras and visions, but real beings that existed independent of
imagination.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">So it happens that the Bible is quite filled with
these words <i>Spirits</i>, <i>Demons</i> and <i>Fiends</i>, but
nowhere is it said when they were first known, nor the time of their
creation, which is hardly pardonable in Moses, who is earnest in
depicting the Creation of Heaven, Earth and Man. No more then is Jesus
Christ who had such close intimacy with them, who commanded them so
absolutely according to the Gospel, and who spoke so often of angels
and good and bad spirits, but without saying whether they were
corporeal or spiritual; which makes it plain that he knew no more than
the Greeks had taught other nations, in which he is not less culpable
than for denying to all men the virtue of faith and piety which he
professed to be able to give them.</p>
<p>But to return to the Spirits. It is certain that the words
<i>Demon</i>, <i>Satan</i> and <i>Devil</i>, are not proper names which
designated any individual, and which never have any credence but among
the ignorant; as much among the Greeks who invented them, as among the
Jews where they were tolerated. So the latter being overrun
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>by them gave them names&mdash;which signified
<i>enemy</i>, <i>accuser</i>, <i>inquisitor</i>,&mdash;as well to
invisible powers as to their own adversaries, the Gentiles, whom they
said inhabited the Kingdom of Satan; there being none but themselves,
in their own opinion, who dwelt in that of God.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As Jesus Christ was a Jew, and consequently imbued
with these silly opinions, we read everywhere in the Gospels, and in
the writings of his Disciples, of the <i>Devil</i>, of <i>Satan</i> and
<i>Hell</i> as if they were something real and effective. While it is
true, as we have shown, that there is nothing more imaginary, and when
what we have said is not sufficient to prove it, but two words will
suffice to convince the most obstinate. All Christians agree
unanimously that God is the first principle and the foundation of all
things, that he has created and preserves them, and without his support
they would fall into nothingness. Following this principle it is
certain that God must have created what is called the <i>Devil</i>, and
<i>Satan</i>, as well as the rest, and if he has created both good and
evil, why not all the balance, and if by this principle all evil
exists, it can only be by the intervention of God.</p>
<p>Now can one conceive that God would maintain a creature, not only
who curses him unceasingly, and who mortally hates him, but even who
endeavors to corrupt his friends, to have the pleasure of being cursed
by a multitude of mouths. How can we comprehend that God should
preserve the Devil to have him do his worst to dethrone him if he
could, and to alienate from his service his elect and his favorites?
What would be the object of God in such conduct? Now what can we say in
speaking of the Devil and Hell. If God does <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>all,
and nothing can be done without him how does it happen that the Devil
hates him, curses him, and takes away his friends? Now he is either
agreeable, or he is not. If he <i>is</i> agreeable, it is certain that
the Devil in cursing him only does what he should, since he can only do
what God wills. Consequently, it is not the Devil, but God in person
who curses himself; a situation to my idea more absurd than ever.</p>
<p>If it is not in accord with his will then it is not true that he is
all powerful. Thus there are two principles, one of Good, the other of
Evil, one which causes one thing and the other that does quite the
contrary. To what does this reasoning lead us? To avow without
contradiction that there is no God such as is conceived, nor Devil, nor
Soul, nor Paradise, such as has been depicted, and that the
Theologians, that is to say, those who relate fables for truth, are
persons of bad faith who maliciously abuse the credulity of the
ignorant by telling them what they please, as if the people were
capable of nothing but chimera or who should be fed with insipid food
in which is found only emptiness, nothingness and folly, and not a
grain of the salt of truth and wisdom. Centuries have passed, one after
the other, in which mankind has been infatuated by these absurd
imaginations which have been combatted; but during all the period there
have also been found sincere minds who have written against the
injustice of the Doctors in Tiaras, Mitres and Gowns, who have kept
mankind in such deplorable blindness which seems to increase every
day.</p>

<p class="first">Hardly had the disciples of Christ abolished the
Mosaic law to introduce the Christian dispensation, than mankind,
carried away by force, and by their ordinary inconstancy, followed a
new law-giver, who advanced himself by the same methods as Moses. He
assumed, like him, the title of prophet, and envoy of God, like him he
performed miracles and knew how to profit by the passions of the
people. First he was accompanied by an ignorant rabble, to whom he
explained the new oracles of heaven. These unfortunates, seduced by the
promises and fables of this new impostor, spread his renown and exalted
him to a height that eclipsed his predecessors. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span></p>
<p>Mahomet was not a man who appeared capable of founding an empire, as
he excelled neither in politics<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4222src"
href="#xd26e4222" name="xd26e4222src">1</a> nor philosophy; in fact,
could neither read nor write. He had so little firmness that he would
often have abandoned his enterprise had he not been forced to persist
in his undertaking by the skill of one of his followers. From that time
he commenced to rise and become celebrated. Corais, a powerful Arab,
jealous that a man of his birth should have the audacity to deceive the
people, declared himself his enemy, and attempted to cross his
enterprise, but the people persuaded that Mahomet had continual
conferences with God and his angels caused him to prevail over his
enemy. The tribe of Corais were at a disadvantage and Mahomet seeing
himself followed by a crazy crowd who thought him a divine man, thought
he would have no need of a companion, but fearing that the latter
(Corais) might expose his impostures he tried to prevent it, and to do
it more certainly he overwhelmed him with promises, and swore to him
that he wished only to become great by sharing the power to which he
had contributed. &ldquo;We have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109"
href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>reached,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;the moment of our elevation, we are sure of the great multitude
we have gained, and we must now assure ourselves by the artifice you
have so happily conceived.&rdquo; At the same time he induced him to
hide himself in the cave of oracles. There was a dried-up well from
which he made the people believe that the voice of God declared himself
for Mahomet, who was in the midst of his proselytes. Deceived by the
caresses of this traitor, his associate went into the well to
counterfeit the oracle as usual; Mahomet then passing by at the head of
an infatuated multitude a voice was heard saying: &ldquo;I who am your
God, declare that I have established Mahomet as the prophet of all
nations: from him you will learn my true law which has been changed by
the Jews and the Christians.&rdquo; For a long time this man played
this game, but in the end he was paid by the greatest and blackest
ingratitude. Mahomet hearing the voice which proclaimed him a divine
being, turned towards the people and commanded them in the name of the
God who recognized him as his prophet, to fill with stones the ditch
from whence had issued such authentic testimony in his favor, in memory
of the stone which Jacob raised to mark the place where God appeared to
him.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4229src" href="#xd26e4229" name=
"xd26e4229src">2</a> Thus perished the unfortunate person who had
contributed to the elevation of Mahomet; it was on this heap of stones
that the last of the celebrated prophets established his law. This
foundation is so stable and founded in such a way that after a thousand
years of reign it has no appearance of being overthrown. <span class=

&ldquo;Mahomet,&rdquo; says the Count de Boulainvilliers, &ldquo;was
ignorant of common knowledge, as I believe, but he assuredly knew much
of what a great traveler might acquire with much native wit, when he
employed it usefully. He was not ignorant of his own language, the use
of which, and not by reading, taught him its nicety and beauty. He was
not ignorant of the art of knowing how to render odious what was truly
culpable, and to portray the truth with simple and lively colors in a
manner which could not be forgotten. In fact, all that he has said is
true in comparison with the essential dogmas of religion, but he has
not said all that is true. It is in that particular alone that our
Religion differs from his.&rdquo; He adds further on, &ldquo;that
Mahomet was neither rude nor barbarous, that he conducted his
enterprise with all the art, delicacy, constancy, intrepidity, and all
the other great qualities which would have actuated Alexander or Cesar
were they in his place.&rdquo; <i>Life of Mahomet, by Count de

<p>Many maintain that there is a God, and that he should be worshipped,
before they understand either what a God is, or what it is to be, as
far as being is common to bodies and spirits, according to the
distinction they make; and what it is to worship God, although they
regard the worship of God according to the standard of the honor given
to ruling men.</p>
<p>What God is, they describe according to the confession of their own
ignorance. For it is inevitable that they declare how he differs from
other things by the denial of former conceptions. They cannot
comprehend that there is an infinite being; that is, one of whose
limits they are ignorant. There is a creator of heaven and earth, they
say, but who is <i>his</i> creator they do not say, because they do not
know; because they do not understand. Some say that he is the origin of
himself and maintain that he comes from nothing but himself. We do not
understand his origin they say, therefore he has none (why so? if we do
not understand God himself, is there, therefore, no God?) And this is
the first principle of their ignorance.</p>
<p>There is no progression into infinity; why not? because the human
intellect must have some foundation? because it is accustomed to this
belief? because it cannot imagine anything beyond its own limits? As
if, indeed, it followed, that if I do not comprehend infinity,
therefore there is no infinity.</p>
<p>And nevertheless as is known from experience, some among the members
of the sects of Christ, think <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113"
href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>there is an infinite
progression of divine properties or persons, concerning the limitations
of which, however, there has hitherto been dispute, and so indeed they
think that there is a progression <i>into</i> infinity. For the son is
begotten from infinity, and the holy spirit is breathed from infinity.
This begetting and this procession goes on to infinity. For if that
begetting or that breathing of the spirit had begun or should once have
ceased, the conception of eternity would be destroyed. But if you
should agree with them on this point also, that the creation of man can
not be prolonged to infinity, which they infer, however, on account of
their finite minds, it will not yet be evident whether other beings
have not been begotten among the higher powers, in a peculiar manner
and in great number, as well as among men on earth; and who of this
great number should especially be accepted as God. For every religion
admits that there are Gods who are mediators, although they are not all
under equal limitations, whence that principle, that there must be one
being only, raised above men by his own nature, is evidently
demolished. And so it will be possible to say that from a diversity of
Gods as creators, a diversity of religions, and a variety of kinds of
worship afterwards arose: which the religious feeling of the heathen
especially employed. But as to the objection which is raised about the
murders and the concubinage of the Pagan Gods, aside from the fact that
the Pagans have long since shown that these things must be understood
as mysteries, similar things will be found in other religions.</p>
<p>The slaughter of many tribes was perpetrated by Moses and Joshua at
the command of God. Even human sacrifice the God of Israel demanded of
Abraham, but it was not carried into effect in this remarkable case.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span></p>
<p>But he could either not have given a command, or Abraham could not
have believed that it had been given in earnest, which would have been
in itself utterly at variance with the nature of God. Mahomet promises
the whole world as the reward offered by his religion, and Christians
talk about the universal slaughter of their enemies and the subjugation
of the foes of the church, which indeed has not been insignificant,
from the fact that the church had the entire control of public
affairs.</p>
<p>Was not polygamy also permitted by (Mohammed) Moses, and as some
maintain, even in the New Testament, by Christ? Did not the Holy Spirit
beget the son of God by a peculiar union with a betrothed virgin?</p>
<p>As for other objections which are made to the pagans about their
ridiculous idols, and their misuse of worship, they are not so weighty
that similar ones can not be made to the members of other sects;
nevertheless it can easily be proved that these abuses have proceeded
from the subordinates rather than from the leaders, from the disciples,
rather than from the masters of religions.</p>
<p>But to return to the former argument. This <i>being</i>,&mdash;since
the intellect limits its extent,&mdash;is what some call Nature and
others God. On these points some agree, others disagree. Some fancy
that the worlds have existed from eternity, and call the connection of
things God; certain ones call God an individual being, which can be
neither seen or known, although among these disputes are not
infrequent.</p>
<p>Religion, as far as it concerns worship, some attribute to the fear,
some to the love, of invisible powers. But if the invisible powers are
false, idolatry is just as the principles of each worshipper demand.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span></p>
<p>They will have it that love springs from kindness and refer it to
gratitude; although nevertheless it chiefly arises from the sympathy of
humors. The kind deeds of enemies inspire especially violent hatred
although no one of the hypocrites has dared to confess it. But who
would suppose that love arises from the kindness of him who gave to man
the characteristics of a lion, a bear and other wild beasts that he
might assume a nature contrary to the will of the creator? Who, well
knowing the weakness of human nature, placed before [our progenitors] a
tree, by which he was sure they would bring a fatal sentence upon
themselves and their descendants (as some will have it)? And yet the
latter are bound to worship and to perform deeds of gratitude, as if
for a great favor, Forsooth! So the <i>Ithacan</i> may have it,
<i>etc.</i> Take deadly arms, a sword for instance, and if you had the
most certain foreknowledge (which some claim for God also in this very
case, inasmuch as there can be no chance with God) of the very purpose
that he, before whose eyes you place it, will seize it and inflict on
himself and all his descendants the most dreadful death. (He who has
still one drop of the milk of human kindness will shudder to do such a
deed). Take, I say, a sword, you who are a father, for instance, or you
who are a friend; and if you are a father, if you are a real friend,
present it to your friend, or your children, with the command that they
should <i>not</i> run upon it, you foreseeing beyond all doubt,
nevertheless, that he <i>will</i> run upon it, and inflict on his
children and those hitherto innocent, the most dreadful death.
Consider, you who are a father, would you do such a thing? What is it
to make a command a mockery, if this is not? And nevertheless God must
have given such a command. But <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116"
href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>they maintain that God should
be worshipped for his kindness, saying: If God <i>is</i>, he must be
worshipped; just as they make this inference, the Great Mogul
<i>is</i>, therefore he must be worshipped. His own people do indeed
worship him, but why? assuredly that his unbridled pride and that of
all great men may be gratified, and for no other reason. For he is
worshipped chiefly on account of the fear of his visible power (hence
at his death the worship ceases), and then too on account of the hope
of rewards. This same reason exists for the reverence shown parents and
other people in power; and since invisible powers are considered more
important and greater than visible ones, therefore, they will have it
that still more should they be worshipped. And this God should be
worshipped on account of his love, they say. And what kind of love is
it to expose innocent posterity to infinite suffering on account of the
fall of one man, certainly foreseen and therefore foreordained
(foreordained as far at least as being permitted). But, you say, they
are to be redeemed. But how? The father exposes his only son to extreme
suffering, that he may deliver the other man from tortures no greater,
because of the redemption offered by the former.</p>
<p>The Barbarians had no such silly idea. But why should God be loved,
why worshipped? because he created us? But to what end? that we should
fall! because assuredly he had foreknowledge that [our progenitors]
would fall, and set before them the medium of the forbidden fruit,
without which they could not have fallen. Granted, however, that he
should be worshipped because on him all things depend for their
creation; some, nevertheless, add, for their continued existence also,
and their preservation. Why <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href=
"#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>should God be worshipped? Does he
himself delight in worship? Certainly. Parents and benefactors are
honored among us. But why is this honor given? Human nature has regard
for mutual wants and, the bestowal of honor is due to the idea that we
can be aided by a greater and more enduring power. No one wishes to aid
another unless his own wants are satisfied in turn. That is called a
person&rsquo;s recognition of kindness and gratitude, which demands a
greater recognition of his own kindness; and in order that his
reputation may be spread abroad, it demands that the other be ready, as
a handmaid, so to speak, to inspire in others an idea of his fame and
nobility. Doubtless the idea others may entertain of our ability to be
of service to general or individual needs, tickles us, and raises
plumes for us like those of a peacock, wherefore generosity is found
among the virtues. But who does not see the imperfection of our nature?
Who, however, would say that God, the most perfect of all beings, wants
anything? Or that he wishes for any such thing if he is perfect and
already self-sufficient and honored without any external honors. Who
would say that he wants honor except those who persist in honoring
him?</p>
<p>The desire for honor is a sign of imperfection and lack of
power.</p>
<p>The consensus of opinion among all races on this subject, is urged
by those who have talked with scarcely all even of their own friends,
or have examined three or four books treating of the testimony of the
world, not even carefully considering how far the authors had knowledge
of the customs of the world; but those excellent authors were not
familiar with <i>all</i> customs. Notice, however, that when one is
considering the matter, the objection here arises, that the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>fundamental reasons for worship are connected
with God himself and his works, and not with the elementary
constitution of any society. For there is no one who is not aware that
worship is due to the custom, prevalent among the ruling and rich
classes especially, of maintaining some external form of religion in
order to calm the passions of the people.</p>
<p>But if you are concerned about the former reason, who would believe
that in the principal seat of the Christian
religion,&mdash;Italy,&mdash;there are so many free-thinkers, or to
speak more meaningly, Atheists, and if he should believe it, would say
that there is a consensus of opinion among all races. God <i>is</i>,
therefore should he be worshipped? Because, forsooth, the wiser men at
least say so? Who, pray, are the wiser? The high priest, the augurs,
the soothsayers of the ancients, Cicero, Caesar, the leading men and
their priestly adherents, etc.</p>
<p>Would they let it be known that such practices were to their
interests? Doubtless those in control of public affairs, deriving their
profits from the credulity of the people, told fear-inspiring stories
of the power and vengeance of the invisible gods, and lied about their
own occasional meetings and association with them; and demanded in
proportion to their own luxury beings suitable for or even surpassing
themselves. For it is not to be wondered at that priests promulgate
such teachings, since this is their method of maintaining their own
lives. And such are the teachings of the wiser men.</p>
<p>This world may depend on the control of a prime mover; this is
certainly the fact&mdash;that the dependence will be only at the start.
For why might there not have been a first command of God, such that
everything <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>would go in a foreordained course to a fixed
end, if he wished to fix one. There would no longer be need of new
care, dependence or support, but he might at first have endowed every
one with sufficient powers. And why should it not be said that he did
this? For it is not to be supposed that he visits all the elements and
parts of the universe as a physician does a sick man.</p>
<p>What then is to be said of the testimony of conscience? and whence
would come those fears of the mind because of wrong-doing, were it not
evident that there is near us a higher power who sees and punishes us,
whom wrong-doing displeases just as it is altogether at variance with
worship of him? It is not now my purpose to inquire more deeply into
the nature of good and evil nor the dangers of prejudice and the folly
of great fear which springs from preconceived ideas. This merely I say.
Whence did they arise? especially since all evil-doing depends on the
corruption and destruction of the harmony resulting from the
interchange of services in the wants to which the human race is
subject, and since the idea about one who wishes to <i>increase</i>
rather than to be of <i>aid</i> in those wants, renders him an object
of hatred. Whence it happens that he himself may fear lest he may incur
the hatred and contempt of others, or a like refusal to satisfy his
wants; or may lose his power of being of service not only to others but
to himself, in so far indeed as he needs to fear any harm from being
wronged by others.</p>
<p>And so, they say, those who do not have the light of Holy
Scriptures, follow the natural light in accordance with the dictates of
their consciences, which proves to be sure, that God has endowed the
intellect of all men with some sparks of his own knowledge and will,
and if they act according to these it must be said <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>that
they have done right. For what reason of theirs can be a command to
worship God if this is not? But it is maintained on many grounds that
beasts act according to the guide of reason, and this matter has not
yet been decided; nevertheless I do not urge this. Who has said
anything to you to prove that this does not occur, or that a trained
animal does not at times surpass an ignorant and uneducated man in
intellect and powers of judgment? But to speak to the point, the
majority of men of leisure who have had time to consider subtile ideas
and those beyond the comprehension of the ordinary intellect, in order
to gratify their own pride and promote their own advantage, have
devised many subtile principles for which Alexis and Thyrsis, prevented
by their pastoral and rustic duties, could have had no leisure.
Wherefore, the latter have placed confidence in the philosophers of
leisure, as if they were wiser, while they are more fitted to impose on
the foolish. Hence, good Alexis, go to, worship the sylvan Pans, Satyrs
and Dianas, etc. For the great philosophers will tell you about the
dream of Numa Pompilius, and narrate to you the story of his
concubinage with the nymph Aegeria, and they will wish by this very
account to bind you to his worship, and as a reward for this pious
work, because of the reconciliation and favor of those invisible
powers, they will demand for their own support, the flower of your
flock and your labor as a sacrifice. And hence, since Titius worshipped
Pan, Alexis, the Fauns, Rome, the Gods of War, Athens, the unknown
Gods, is it to be supposed that those good men learned from the light
of reason certain tales which were the idle inventions and ideas of
philosophers? not to attack too harshly the religion of others.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span></p>
<p>And why did not this reason also tell that they were mistaken in
their worship, in foolishly worshipping statues and stones, as if they
were the dwelling places of their Gods? But is it indeed to be supposed
that since good women bestowed such worship on Francis, Ignatius and
Dominicus and such men, reason teaches that at least some one among
holy men should be worshipped? That they learn from the light of nature
the worship of some superior power no longer visible<span class="corr"
id="xd26e4357" title="Source: ?">,</span> although, nevertheless, such
are the fabrications of our priests of leisure for the more splendid
increase of their own means of support.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no God? Suppose there is (a God.) Therefore,
should he be worshipped? But this does not follow, because he desires
worship as far as he has inscribed it in the heart. What more then? We
should then follow the guide of our nature. But this is known to be
imperfect. In what respects? For is it sufficient enough to maintain
the society of men peacefully? Because other religious people,
following revelation, do not pass more tranquil lives?</p>
<p>But is it rather because God demands of us especially a more precise
idea of God? But nevertheless you who promise this of any religion
whatsoever, do not supply it. For any revelation of what God is, is far
more unintelligible than before. And how will you make this clearer by
the conception of the intellect, since he limits every intellect?</p>
<p>What do you think of these things?</p>
<p>No one, I say, has a knowledge of God, moreover eye has not seen
him, and he dwells in unapproachable light, and from the time of
revelation till now, in allegory. But I suppose every one knows how
clear an allegory is. Wherefore do you indeed believe that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>God
makes such demands? or is it from the desire of the intellect to
surmount the limitations of its own capacity in order to comprehend
everything more perfectly than it does, or from something else? Who of
you is there who speaks from special revelation? Good God! what a
hodge-podge of revelations. Do you point to the oracles of the heathen?
Antiquity has already held them up to ridicule. To the testimony of
your priests? I can show you priests who will contradict them. You may
protest in your turn, but who will be the judge? Who will put an end to
these disputes? Do you call attention to the writings of Moses, the
Prophets and Apostles? I bring to your notice the Koran, which says
that, according to a new revelation, these are corrupt and its author
boasts of having settled by the sword the corruptions and altercations
of Christians as did Moses those of the heathen. For by the sword
Mahomet and Moses subjugated Palestine, each instructed by great
miracles. And the writings of the Sectarians as well as of the Vedas
and the Brahmins 1300 years back, are in opposition, to say nothing of
the Sinenses.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4371src" href="#xd26e4371"
name="xd26e4371src">1</a> You, who in some remote spot in Europe are
disputing about such things disregard or deny these writings. You
yourself should see very clearly that with equal ease they deny
<i>your</i> writings. And what proofs not miraculous, would be
sufficient to convince the inhabitants of the world, if it were evident
from the first three books of Veda, that the world was contained in and
came from an egg of a scorpion, and that the earth and first elements
of things was placed on the head of a bull, if some envious son of the
Gods had not stolen these first three volumes. In our times this would
be laughed at; and among those people <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>there would not be
this strange argument to establish their religion if it did not have
its origin in the brains of these priests.</p>
<p>And whence else came those many immense volumes concerning the gods
of the pagans and those wagon loads of lies? Moses acted very wisely in
first becoming skilled in the arts of the Egyptians, that is in the
mastery of astrology and magic, and then by cruel war driving from
their homes the petty kings of Palestine, and pretending a conference
like that of Numa Pompilius. Leading his army, confident of their
fortunes, into the possessions of peaceful men; in order that he,
forsooth, might be a great general and his brother high priest, and
that he himself might be a leader and dictator. But of what a people!
Others by milder means and by pulling the wool over the eyes of the
people under cover of profound sanctity (I am afraid to mention other
things,) and by the pious deceits of members of their sect in secret
assemblies, first got control of the ignorant country people and then,
because of the growing strength of the new religion, they got control
of those who feared for themselves, and hated a leader of the people.
At length another eager for war, by feigning miracles attached to
himself the more ferocious people of Asia, who had suffered ill
treatment at the hands of commanders of the Christians, and who, like
Moses, with the promise of many victories and favors, he subjugated the
warring and peaceful leaders of Asia, and established his religion by
the sword. The first is considered the reformer of the heathen, the
second of Judaism and the third the reformer of both. It remains to be
seen who will be the reformer of Mahomet and Mahometanism. Doubtless
then, the credulity of men is likely to be imposed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>on,
and to take advantage of this under the pretense of some gain to be
derived, is rightly called <i>imposture</i>.</p>
<p>It would be too long and tedious to show more at length in this
place, the nature and forms of what goes under the name of imposture,
but we must observe, that, even if natural religion is granted and the
worship of God is right as far as it is said to be commanded by nature;
that up to this time the leader of every new religion has been
suspected of imposture, especially since it is evident to all and is
obvious from what has been said or can be said, how many deceptions
have been used in propagating any religion.</p>
<p>It remains then unanswerable according to the previous argument,
that religion and the worship of God according to the promptings of
natural light, is consistent with truth and justice; but if any one
wishes to establish any new principles in religion, either new or
displeasing, and that by the authority of invisible powers, it will
evidently be necessary for him to show his power of reforming, unless
he wishes to be considered by all an impostor. Since, not under the
conclusions of natural religion, nor under the authority of special
revelation, he offers opposition to the ideas of all. Moreover he
should be so upright in life and character that the people may believe
him worthy of being associated with so high and holy a power, who does
not approve of anything impure. Nor can merely his own confession, nor
the holiness of a past life, nor any miracles&mdash;that is
extraordinary deeds&mdash;prove this; for this is common rather among
the skillful and the deceivers of men, lying hypocrites who pursue
their own advantage and glory in this way. For it is not worth
considering that some reached such a degree of madness that they
voluntarily sought death, in order <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125"
href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>that it might be supposed
that they despised and conquered everything, like different ones among
the ancient philosophers. Nor is it to be supposed that they were
upheld by special divine powers in that which they did because of
foolish fancies and fond hopes of mountains of gold, rising from a
defective judgment. For they did not give the matter the proper
consideration, nor did the real teachers, for in order that you may
come to a fair decision about them, I have said not only is their own
testimony not sufficient, but in order to reach the truth of the
matter, they must be compared with one another; and other witnesses
with them, and then their acquaintances and friends, and then
strangers, then friends and enemies; and then after the testimony is
all gathered in, that of each teacher concerning himself, and then that
of others must be compared. And if we do not know the witnesses, we
must consult the witnesses <i>of</i> the witnesses, and so on; besides
instituting an investigation as to <i>your</i> powers of distinguishing
from the true and the false involved in such or other circumstances.
Especially in similar ones, inquiring, moreover, whence you desired
data to learn the truth, for this purpose comparing the judgment of
others, as to what they infer from such an investigation or from the
testimony of witnesses. And from these data it will be permissible to
infer whether he who makes this claim, is a true messenger of the
revelation of divine will and whether his teachings should be gradually
adopted. But at this point we must be very careful not to get into a
circle. Whenever the nature of important religions may be such that one
supplants another, as that of Moses, Paganism, that of Mahomet,
Christianity,&mdash;the later one may not always nor in every
particular cast aside the earlier, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>only in certain
parts, to such an extent that the latter is founded on the former, it
will be necessary to investigate carefully not only either the last, or
the middle, or the first, but all, especially since the charge of
imposture is brought by every sect. So the ancients were charged with
it by Christ, because they corrupted the law; the Christians by
Mahomet, because they corrupted the gospels, a fact not to be wondered
at, inasmuch as one sect of Christians charges the other with
corrupting texts of the New Testament, so that it can [not] be
ascertained whether he who is offered as an example is a teacher of a
true religion or how far those who claim to have been given authority,
should be listened to. For in an investigation no sect must be
overlooked, but each must be compared with the rest without any
prejudice. For if one is overlooked, that perhaps, is the very one
which is nearer the truth. Thus, those who followed Moses, have
followed the truth according to the Christians also, but they ought not
to have paused at that point, but should examine the truth of the
Christian religion also.</p>
<p>Each sect maintains that its own teachers are the best and that it
has had and is daily having proof of this, and that there are no better
ones, so that either every one must believe it, which would be absurd,
or no one, which is the safer plan, until the true way is known, though
no sect should be disregarded in a comparison.</p>
<p>There is no need of presenting the objection that it is known that
all mathematicians agree that twice two is four. For it is not a
similar case, since no one has been known to doubt whether twice two is
four, while on the contrary religions agree neither in end, beginning
nor middle. Suppose that I do not know <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb127" href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>the true way of
salvation; I follow, however, the Brahmins or the Koran. Will not Moses
and the rest say: What wrong have we done you that you thus reject us,
though we are better and nearer the truth? What reply shall we make? I
believed in Mahomet or the Gymnosophistes<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4406src" href="#xd26e4406" name="xd26e4406src">2</a>, in whose
teachings I was born and brought up, and from them I learned that your
religion and that of the Christians which followed, have long since
decayed and grown corrupt, and are still misleading. Will they not
reply that they do not know anything about the others and that these do
not know anything about the true guide to salvation, since they know
that those who are corruptors of the people are impostors, feigning
miracles, or by lies pulling the wool over the eyes of the people. Nor
should faith be thus simply given to one man or one sect, rejecting all
others without a complete and proper investigation. For with equal
right the Ethiopian, who has not left his own land, says that there are
no men under the sun except those of a black color.</p>
<p>Moreover, this precaution also should be taken in the investigation
of other sects, that equal care should be used in an investigation of
all, and while one is explained with great pains, the other should not
be slighted, because one claim or another at first sight <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>seems to be wrong, or because of the evil
reports of gossip concerning the leader of that sect, while other
reports are cast aside. For that should not be set down as doctrine or
indubitable testimony, which the first vagabond that comes along
asserts about a hostile religion. Indeed, with equal right on account
of common gossip and the mere mention of a name, the Christian religion
was to some an object of horror, and to others an object of scorn. With
the latter because the Christians worshipped the head of an ass, and
with the former because they ate and drank their God, so that at length
the report became current that to be a Christian was to be a deadly
enemy of God and men; when, nevertheless, such tales were either things
which had been misunderstood or skillfully told lies, which were then
confirmed, and having some foundation, spread abroad because an enemy
of that religion had absolutely no intercourse, or no proper
intercourse, with the Christians themselves, or the more learned among
them, but believed the first ignorant person or deserter or enemy of
that religion. Such a method of investigation being decided upon, it
would always be a matter of great difficulty. What shall we say about
women, what about children, what about the majority of the masses of
the people? All children will be excluded from a feeling of security in
regard to their religion, and the majority of women to whom even those
matters which have been most clearly explained by the leaders of any
religion, as far as can be done, are obscure: also from their manner of
life you rightly perceive that with the exception of a very few
superior ones, they have no accurate powers of comprehending mysteries
of such a character, to say nothing of the countless numbers of
insignificant persons <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href=
"#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>and country people for whom the
question of their own support is the most important subject for the
exercise of their powers of reason, while other matters they accept or
reject in good faith. Doubtless there is only a very small part of the
world, who weigh all religions, compare their own carefully with others
and correctly distinguish true reasons from false, in details in which
deception may creep in; but the majority rather adopt the faith of
others, of teachers of sacred matters especially, whose knowledge and
powers of judgment in sacred matters are considered noteworthy.</p>
<p>And so in any religion this is done, especially by those who can not
read and write or do not have anything to read. But it should have been
observed that in this matter it is not sufficient that the teachers of
any religion should have the power, because of very exact powers of
judgment and avowed experience, of distinguishing the true from the
false. Indeed it ought to be very certain to others, with powers of
judgment no less exact, that those teachers have not only the ability
to distinguish the true from the false, but the desire as well, and
indeed we ought to be especially certain that he who professes such a
knowledge and desire is neither deceived nor wishes to be.</p>
<p>And what choice shall we make here among so many teachers so much at
variance in even one eminent sect? For when we look at our comrades and
associates, who disagree on many subjects, although they are most
friendly in other respects, one of the two disputants will maintain his
opinion on account of some defect, either because he has not a correct
understanding of the matter, and lacks the power of judgment, or
because he does not wish to give up, and so does not desire to confess
the truth. But although it might be <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb130" href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>matters of secondary
importance in which this happened, nevertheless the result will be that
they will be mistrusted in other matters also. Each doubtless is in
possession of one truth, and he who gives this up in one place, either
from a defect of judgment or a wrong desire is deservedly mistrusted of
doing the same thing in other cases.</p>
<p>Therefore, that you may judge of the ability and honesty of any
teacher in religion, <i>first</i>, it is necessary for you to be just
as able as he; for otherwise he will be able to impose on you very
easily, and, moreover, if he is unknown to you, he will need the
testimony of others, and these again of others, and so on indefinitely;
not only in regard to his truthfulness, that he really taught such
doctrines, but in regard to his honesty, that he did this without
deceit. And the same method must at once be employed in regard to the
witnesses of his honesty and his teachings. But where will you place an
end to this? It is not enough that such discussions have already taken
place among others; you must consider how well this has been done. For
the ordinary proofs which are set forth are neither conclusive nor
manifest, and prove doubtful matters by others more doubtful, so that,
like those who run in a circle, you return to the starting point.</p>
<p>In order that it may be manifest whether any one is a teacher of a
true religion or an impostor, there is need either of personal
knowledge, which we can not have in the case of the three great
founders of the religions of Judaism, Christianity and Mahometanism,
inasmuch as they lived in far distant places and died long before our
time; or of the knowledge of others, which, if any one imparts it to
you, we call testimony.</p>
<p>Between these, there is still another way of knowing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>any
one, namely through his own writings, which may be called one&rsquo;s
own testimony concerning himself. And concerning Christ, there is no
such testimony; concerning Moses, it is doubtful whether there is;
concerning Mahomet, there is the Koran. The testimony of others is of
two classes&mdash;that of friends and that of enemies. Between these
extremes there is no third class, according to the saying, &ldquo;who
is not with me is against me.&rdquo; Mahomet in his writings assumes
and attributes to himself the same divine qualities as did Moses and
another. Moreover the friends of Mahomet and members of his sect wrote
the same things concerning him as did the members of the sects of the
others concerning their masters, and the enemies of the others wrote
just as disparagingly of them as <i>their</i> friends did of Mahomet.
As for the rest, the testimony of any one concerning himself is too
unreliable to inspire implicit confidence, and is of no consequence
except, perchance, to perplex a thoughtless hearer. The assertions of
friends, who doubtless unanimously repeat the sayings of their masters,
are of the same nature. Nor should the enemies of any one be heeded on
account of their prejudices. But as it is, in spite of these facts, it
is for such trivial reasons, which are confirmed only by the
master&rsquo;s own boasts, the assertions of friends, or the calumnies
of enemies, that every follower of any one of the three assumes that
the claims of his enemy are based wholly on imposture, while the
teachings of his master are founded wholly on truth. Nevertheless
Mahomet is undoubtedly considered an impostor among us; but why? Not
from his own testimony or that of his friends but from that of his
enemies. Then, on the contrary, among the Mahometans he is considered a
most holy prophet; but why? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href=
"#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>From his own testimony, but
especially from that of his friends. Whoever considers Moses an
impostor or a holy teacher employs the same method of reasoning. And
there is equal reason in the case of Mahomet as in the case of the
others, either for charging him with imposture or for answering that
charge, although, nevertheless, the former are considered holy, while
he is considered a scoundrel, contrary to all the demands of justice.
To put it in the scholastic manner, then, the following conclusions are
most firmly established: Whenever there is the same reason as in the
case of Mahomet for charging any person with imposture or for answering
that charge, they should be placed in the same category. And for
example, in the case of Moses, there is the same reason, therefore
justice should be demanded just as in the case of Mahomet, nor should
he be considered an impostor.</p>
<p>PROOF OF MINOR PREMISE.</p>
<p>(a.) In regard to the rebuttal of the charge of imposture: this is
based on the above-mentioned testimony not only of Mahomet concerning
himself in his well-known writings, but on that of every one of his
friends concerning their master, and hence, it logically follows:</p>
<p>(I.) Whatever value the testimony of Moses&rsquo; friends has in
defending him on the charge of imposture, the testimony of
Mahomet&rsquo;s friends ought to have the same value. And whatever the
value of the acquittal, though their favorable testimony, etc., etc.
Therefore, etc.</p>
<p>(II.) And whatever value the books of Moses have for this purpose,
the same value the Koran has also. And so, etc. Therefore, etc.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span></p>
<p>Moreover, the Mussulmen, from the very books of the New Testament
(although according to these very persons, these books have been much
corrupted in other respects,) draw various arguments even in support of
their Mahomet, and especially that prediction of Christ concerning the
future Paraclete.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4455src" href="#xd26e4455"
name="xd26e4455src">3</a> They maintain that he came and exposed the
corruption of the Christians, and established a new covenant. And
although at other times the Koran is charged with many silly, nay
impious tales, all these nevertheless, can be explained in a spiritual
sense or smoothed over in other ways, since the rest of the teachings
insist on nothing but extreme sanctity and a stringent mode of morals,
but especially on temperance and abstinence from wine. And to the
objection frequently raised that wine is the gift of God, the reply can
be made that so also are poisons, and yet we are not supposed to drink
them. The further objection often made that the spirit of the Koran is
too carnal, and fills eternal life with pleasures of the world and the
flesh, polygamy moreover being so indiscriminately permitted, it is not
of such weight that it can not be confuted, since Moses also permitted
polygamy and in the New Testament life eternal admits of banquets, e.
g., you will sit down with Abraham and Isaac, etc., etc. Again, I shall
not taste wine except in the Kingdom of my Father. It is said that all
those pleasures mentioned in the Song of Solomon, which is, of course,
also instanced, are not wrong, and when explained in a spiritual sense
imply no wrong, although the same thing is not said of the Koran. And
if we are too severely critical of the words of the Koran, we ought to
employ the same severity of criticism against the writings of Moses and
others. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span>Moreover the arguments which are offered from
Moses himself in answer to the charge of imposture, do not seem
reasonable nor of sufficient weight.</p>
<p>(I.) Our knowledge of the intercourse Moses had with God depends on
his own testimony and that of his friends, and hence such evidence can
have no more weight than similar arguments of the Mussulmen concerning
the conference that Mahomet had with Gabriel; and what is more, this
intercourse of Moses, according to Moses himself (if all those sayings
are Moses&rsquo;, which are commonly attributed to him) is open to the
suspicion of imposture, as is to be shown below.</p>
<p>(II.) No one indeed who is acquainted with the many very grave
crimes of Moses, will be able to say easily or at least justly, that
his holiness of life can not easily be matched. His crimes then are the
following:</p>
<p>(a.) Fraud, which none but his friends have palliated, but they are
not impartial judges of the matter; nor does that commendatory passage
of Luke in the Acts of the Apostles form any apology, for there is
dispute as to the honesty and veracity of that witness.</p>
<p>(b.) The stirring up of rebellion; for it can not be proved that
this was due to a command of God, nay, the contrary is clear, since
elsewhere Moses is urged to forbid resistance to tyrants.</p>
<p>(c.) Wars, although murder is contrary to the V. and VII.
(?VI.)<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4472src" href="#xd26e4472" name=
"xd26e4472src">4</a> commandments of Moses himself, unrestrained
plunder, etc., etc.; just as the high priest in India, or Mahomet in
his land, offering the command of God as a pretext, drove from their
territory the former possessors. Moses slew thousands and gave them
over to slaughter in order to insure salvation to himself and his
people. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span></p>
<p>(d.) The teaching concerning the taking of the property of others
under the pretense of a loan.</p>
<p>(e.) The prayer to God in which Moses desired to die eternally for
his people, although this petition asked of God such things as would
destroy his essence. See <a class="biblink xd26e45" title=

name="xd26e4513src">7</a></p>
<p>As to</p>
<p>(b.) The proof of the other argument, namely, the charge of
imposture, it can be said: We believe that Mahomet was an impostor, not
from our personal knowledge, as was pointed out above, but from the
testimony, not of his friends, but of his enemies. But all such are
anti-Mahometans, according to the saying &ldquo;Who is not with me is
against me,&rdquo; etc., etc.: hence follows the conclusion: Whatever
weight the testimony of enemies has in the case of one, that it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>ought to have in the case of the other also.
Otherwise we shall be unjust in condemning one from the testimony of
enemies and not the other; if this were done, all justice would be at
an end.</p>
<p>And in the case of Mahomet, the testimony of enemies has such
weight, that he is considered an Impostor, therefore, etc., etc.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I say that reasons for suspecting Moses of imposture
can be elicited not only from external, but from internal evidence,
whereby imposture can be proved by his own testimony as well as by that
of others, albeit, his followers, although there is still dispute.</p>
<p>(I.) Whether the books, which are said to be those of Moses, are his
or (II.) those of compilers, (III.) or those of Esdras, especially, and
(IV.) whether they were written in the Samaritan, or (V.) the real
Hebrew language; and (VI.) if the latter, whether we can understand
that language. All these matters are doubtful for many reasons, and
especially it can be shown from the first chapters of Genesis that we
can not correctly interpret that language. I confess I am unwilling to
concern myself with these points, but I wish to discuss the man.</p>
<p>I. From Moses&rsquo; own testimony and indeed</p>
<p>(a.) concerning his life and character which we have considered
above, and which, if any blame is attached to Mahomet on account of the
fierce wars he waged, especially against the innocent, is equally
blamable, and in other respects does not seem at all different from
Mahomet&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>(b.) Concerning the authority of his own teaching. And here applies
what was said above about Moses&rsquo; intercourse with God, which
Moses indeed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>boasted of but evidently with too great
exaggeration. For if any one boasts of intercourse with God of an
impossible nature, his intercourse is properly doubted and Moses, etc.
Therefore, etc. It is proved because he boasts of having seen that of
which in the Old and in the New Testament afterward, it is very often
said that no eye has seen (namely) God face to face. <a class=

Numbers xii. 8</a>.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4547src" href=
"#xd26e4547" name="xd26e4547src">8</a> Thus he saw God (1) in his own
form, not in a vision nor in a dream (2), but face to face as friend to
friend when he spoke directly to him. But any vision, which (1) is like
that of friends speaking face to face, directly to one another, (2)
like that of the blessed in the other life, is properly called and
considered a vision of God. And Moses, etc. Therefore, etc. The
<i>Minor premise</i> is proved from the passages previously cited and
from the words of the Apostle: then indeed face to face, etc., and
there is the same argument in the passages of Moses and in that of the
Apostle. And yet among Christians the belief is most firmly established
that no unjust person can see God in this life. And in the above
passage of <a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ex%2033:20&amp;version=NRSV">

"#xd26e4568" name="xd26e4568src">9</a> it is expressly added: you will
not be able to see my face. These words God addressed to Moses and they
are in direct contradiction to the passages previously cited, so that
these claims can be explained in no other way than by saying that they
were added by a thoughtless compiler, but by so doing the whole is
rendered doubtful. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138"

<p>(c.) Concerning the teachings of Moses, which relate either to the
laws or the gospel. Among the laws, all of which for the sake of
brevity I can not now consider, the decalogue is most important, being
called the special work of God and said to have been written on Mount
Horeb. But it is evident it was devised by Moses before it was written
by God, because these commands are not in themselves characterized by
the perfection of God, since (1) they are either superfluous, namely
the last three, arguing from the words of Christ in <a class=
"biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mt%205&amp;version=NRSV">Math.
v</a>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4581src" href="#xd26e4581" name=
"xd26e4581src">10</a> undoubtedly relating to the former, while the IX
should not be separated from the X, and they will likewise be
superfluous (2) or they are defective. For where are these
commandments: thou shalt not desire to have other Gods, nor desire to
curse God, nor desire to desecrate the Sabbath, nor to injure thy
parents, and similar ones? And is it to be presumed that God would
forbid the lesser sins of coveting a neighbor&rsquo;s house, land and
property especially, and in an order so extraordinary, and not the
greater? As to the teaching of Moses concerning the gospel, he
establishes a very foolish and untrustworthy sign of the future great
prophet, or Christ. <a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deut%2018%2021-22&amp;version=NRSV">
Deut. xviii, 21, 22</a>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4591src" href=
"#xd26e4591" name="xd26e4591src">11</a> since this sign makes faith
impossible for a long time. From this dictum it follows that Christ,
having predicted the fall of Jerusalem, ought not to have been
considered a true prophet while that prophecy was as yet unfulfilled
(nor should Daniel, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139"
name="pb139">139</a>]</span>until his prophecy had been fulfilled), and
so those who lived in the interval between the time of Christ and the
overthrow of Judea, can not be blamed for not believing in him,
although Paul hurled anathemas at those who did not attach themselves
to Christ before the fall.</p>
<p>Whatever sign, then, permits people for a long time to believe what
they please with impunity, can not proceed from God, but is justly
subject to suspicion. And this sign was given, etc., therefore,
etc.</p>
<p>What is said concerning the fulfillment of other prophecies is no
objection. For it is the special and genuine sign of that great
prophet, that his predictions are fulfilled. Wherefore, naturally,
previous to this fulfillment he could not have been considered such a
prophet.</p>
<p>The other absurd conclusion which evidently follows from this
passage, is this: that although this sign ought to have been the proof
of the divine inspiration of all prophets, in the case of certain
prophets who made predictions, indefinite indeed, but in words not
admitting a moral interpretation (such as soon, swiftly, near, etc.,)
that sign can by no means be found, e. g. Many predict the last day of
the world and Peter said that that day was at hand; therefore, so far,
until it comes it will be impossible to consider him a true
prophet.</p>
<p>For such is the express requirement Moses makes in the passage
cited.</p>
<p>(d.) Concerning the histories of Moses. But if the Koran is charged
with containing many fables, doubtless in Genesis there are many
stories to arouse the suspicions of the thoughtful reader: as the
creation of man from the dust of the earth, the inspiration of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>the breath of life, the creation of Eve from the
rib of the man, serpents speaking and seducing human beings, who were
very wise and well aware that the serpent was possessed by the father
of lies, the eating of an apple which was to bring punishment upon the
whole world, which would make finite one of the attributes of God,
namely his clemency (the attributes of God being identical with his
essence), as the redemption of the fallen would make finite the wrath
of God, and so God himself: for the wrath of God is God himself; men
eight or nine hundred years old; the passage of the animals into the
ark of Noah, the tower of Babel, the confusion of tongues, etc., etc.
These and a thousand other stories can not fail to impress the
investigating freethinker as being similar to the fables, especially of
the Rabbins since the Jewish race is very much addicted to the use of
fables; nor at all inconsistent with other works, to mention those of
Ovid, the Vedas, those of the Sinenses and the Brahmins of India, who
tell that a beautiful daughter born from an egg bore the world, and
similar absurdities. But Moses especially seems to arrest our attention
because he represents God as contradicting himself, namely, saying that
all things were good and yet that it was not good for Adam to be alone.
Whence it follows that there was something apart from Adam that was not
good and so could injure the good condition of Adam, while,
nevertheless, the solitude of Adam itself was the work of God, since he
had created goodness not only of the essences but also of the
qualities.</p>
<p>For all things were good in that quality in which God had created
them. I adduce as proof: It is impossible for any work created by God
not to be good. And the solitude of Adam, etc., etc. Therefore, etc.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span></p>
<p>Whoever enters upon the study of the genealogies of the Old
Testament finds many difficulties in Moses. I shall not now cite all,
contenting myself with merely this one example, since Paul, I. Tim. i.,
4,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4627src" href="#xd26e4627" name=
"xd26e4627src">12</a> has taught that genealogies are useless, and the
study of them unprofitable, nay, to be avoided. Of what use were so
many separate, nay, so oft times repeated, genealogies? And there is a
remarkable example to arouse suspicion at least of the corruption of
the text or of the carelessness of compilers, in the case of the wives
of Esau and the different things said of them.</p>

<p>I do not yet see how these names are to be reconciled. And these and
similar passages increase the suspicion that the writings of Moses
which we have, have been put together by compilers and that errors in
writing have crept in at some time.</p>

the same amount of difference, as if different passages had been
collected from different authors.</p>

Galatians 3, 4</a>.</i> Even so we when we were children, were in
bondage under the elements of the world: but when the fulness of the
time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the
law. v. 9. But now after that ye have known God, or rather are known of
God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye
desire again to be in bondage.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">v. 30. Nevertheless what saith the Scripture?
cast out the bond-woman and her son: for the son of the bond-woman
shall not be heir with the son of the free-woman.</p>

II. Cor. iii., 6&ndash;10</a>. Who also hath made us able ministers of
the New Testament, not of the letter, but of the spirit; for the letter
killeth, but the spirit giveth life. But if the ministration of death,
written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of
Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of
his countenance; which glory was to be done away: How shall not the
ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? For if the ministration
of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of

<p class="first">In the library of Cornell University, at Ithaca, N.
Y., is a large collection of Spinoza manuscripts and printed books by
the same author. The collection was left to the library, and is known
as the &ldquo;Strauss Collection.&rdquo; In the collection is a
manuscript copy of &ldquo;<i lang="fr">La vie et l&rsquo;esprit de M.
Benoit de Spinosa</i>,&rdquo; which includes &ldquo;<i lang="fr">Le
trait&eacute; des trois Imposteurs</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This particular manuscript is much longer than any of the printed
editions of <i lang="fr">Trait&eacute; des Trois Imposteurs</i>, and
includes several more chapters than another manuscript which is in same
library.</p>
<p>The printed editions usually contain six chapters, although the
edition <i lang="fr">&agrave; Philadelphie</i>, 1796, alluded to on
pages 18&ndash;19, contains nine chapters. None of the printed editions
that I have seen contains a chapter entitled <i>Numa Pompilius</i>.</p>
<p>The manuscript in Cornell library has six additional chapters more
than our manuscript, 1716, which chapters are entitled: 1.
<i>Religions.</i> 2. <i>Of the Diversity of Religions.</i> 3.
<i>Divisions of Christians.</i> 4. <i>The Superstitious,&mdash;of the
superstition and credulity of the people.</i> 5. <i>Of the Origin of
Monarchies.</i> 6. <i>Of Legislators and Politicians, and how they
serve themselves with Religion.</i></p>
<p>These chapters being but an elaboration of the matters and ideas
contained in our English translation.&mdash;A. N. <span class=

lest I tread on your favorite Quixotism. Suffice it to say that it has
a noble purpose. It aims at nothing less than the complete
transformation of human society, by the use of means which, to say the
least, seem quite inadequate. After the minutes of the last meeting
have been read, and the objects of the society have been once more
stated with much detail, there is an opportunity for discussion from
the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps there is some one who may give some new suggestions,
or who may desire to ask a question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You have observed what happens to the unfortunate questioner. What a
sorry exhibition he makes of himself! No sooner does he open his mouth
than every one recognizes his intellectual feebleness. He seems unable
to grasp the simplest ideas. He stumbles at the first premise, and lies
sprawling at the very threshold of the argument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If what I have taken for granted be true,&rdquo; says the
chairman, &ldquo;do not all the fine things I have been telling you
about follow necessarily?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; murmurs the questioner, &ldquo;the things you
take for granted are just what trouble me. They don&rsquo;t correspond
to my experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor, feeble minded questioner!&rdquo; cry the members of the
society, &ldquo;to think that he is not able to take things for
granted! And then to set up his experience against our constitution and
by-laws!&rdquo;</p>
